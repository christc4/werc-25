# RisingThumb's build of dirdir

dirdir is werc's directory management tool.

## Features

This adds a few features to dirdir.

- Ability to edit larger text files
- Ability to edit template files
- Ability to upload files(optionally under a different name)
- Ability to delete a page
- Ability to delete a folder

## Roadmap

- Ideally take some filetype info for making new pages. Would be nice to make tpl files this way.
- User permissioning around editing template files (default config off?)
- Possibly allowing different markdown/formatters to be used.
