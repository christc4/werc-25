## Miscellaneous before cleaning

Looking at friend's personal website and his recent updates

Discussing carnivor diet
	- vegetables are basically garnish
	- fruits are basically highly sugarized veggies

Look at Xah Lee [keyboard blog](http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboarding.html)

In vim to join multiple lines to one line, `S-J` after putting in visual mode

What is the point of minified css/html?
	- Easier job for the parser
	- [Luke Smith](https://youtu.be/69byq_5xKkE?si=JjvCKOvGced5A3Yo)
	- Looked at random person's [carrd](https://lvjnsl-extra.carrd.co/) site
	- Inline css and inline svg 

Using inline css for image background
	- Before my friend used `<link rel="stylesheet" href="red.css">`
	- To call upon an external css but it was a very simple css thing which only needed
	- ` <style>body { background: url(.pix/cov.avif) no-repeat bottom right !important; }</style>`
	- However, .svg didn't want to play by those rules, so more research is needed on how to make an svg a .css background

Redundant vocabulary
	- CSS stylesheet
	- PIN number
	- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome)
	- <s>Mice's</s> mice
	
In browser, C-F5 shows most recent changes, as I think it clears the cache as opposed to C-r
