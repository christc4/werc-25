#Summary of events

Watched in agony as yusufa got erased from existance, leaving not a speck behind...

Saw undeniable evidence of the neatness of being able to append a line of code without having to view the entirety of the file.

Getting angrier thinking about university lectures for the sake of learning some chinese.
Seen some scary websites: some with impressive technical skill and some with impressively sad content.

Looked at some wonderful planes, including a figurative kamikaze guy.

Did indeed go ham on legs after all.
