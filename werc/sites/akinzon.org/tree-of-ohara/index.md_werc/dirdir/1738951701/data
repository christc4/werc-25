JavaFX is a group of Java Classes used to create GUIs

## [JavaFX](#javafx-binding)

Up: [JavaFX](#javafx)

In JavaFX, binding is a way of synchronising the values of two components/variables.

The motivation for it is to have interface elements ([nodes](javafx-nodes))

keep up-to-date with underlying data.

JavaFX uses [Properties](javafx-properties) to implement binding.

Binding can be one-way, where a property B updates when property A updates.

Binding can also be two-way, where property B can affect property A as well.

## [JavaFX Properties](#javafx-properties)

Up: [JavaFX Binding](#javafx)

In JavaFX, properties are bindable versions of typical data types

Their sole purpose is to implement binding

Properties help us to separate application data/application logic from the GUI

## [JavaFX Nodes](#javafx-nodes)

In JavaFX, Nodes are the individual components that appear on the screen

Nodes can be containers for other nodes
