## [JavaFX](#javafx)

JavaFX is a group of Java Classes used to create GUIs

## [JavaFX](#javafx-binding)

Up: [JavaFX](#javafx)

In JavaFX, binding is a way of synchronising the values of two components/variables.

The motivation for it is to have interface elements ([nodes](#javafx-nodes))

keep up-to-date with underlying data.

JavaFX uses [Properties](javafx-properties) to implement binding.

Binding can be one-way, where a property B updates when property A updates.

Binding can also be two-way, where property B can affect property A as well.

## [JavaFX Properties](#javafx-properties)

Up: [JavaFX Binding](#javafx)

In JavaFX, properties are bindable versions of typical data types

Their sole purpose is to implement binding

Properties help us to separate application data/application logic from the GUI

## [JavaFX Nodes](#javafx-nodes)

In JavaFX, Nodes are the individual components that appear on the screen

Nodes can be containers for other nodes

# Ransomware


Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts user data, holding it ransom, until the user pays a price to get it back.

**How it (typically works):**
1) The attacker sends a deceptive email with malicious documents that look legitimate.
2) When executed on the target's machine, the attachment prompts the user to execute a macro or launch PowerShell to download the real payload.
3) Once this has been installed, the payload encrypts sensitive files, which can only be decrypted by paying the ransom.
4) Once encrypted, the payload displays a message saying that the user's files have been encrypted, and that they must pay a ransom to get them back.
