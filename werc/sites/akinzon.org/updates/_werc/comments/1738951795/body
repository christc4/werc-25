Background

Today, I have been working on fixing the styling bug for the map. This bug meant that the proper colours for the map (green for grass, red for enemies) wouldn't show, but rather everything would appear as grey except for the player, who appears white. After some investigation, I came to the conclusion that it was a result of the multiple mob threads who all had their own separate calls to redrawing and styling the map, which caused a delay in the actual styling and therefore the slower instructions (setting the grass and enemies) would not run, and therefore only the grey and white would appear.

Analysis

To investigate this problem further, I decided to play with the number of mobs, and therefore the number of active threads. I found out that the fewer mob threads were active, the more stable the styling of the map was. The converse was true, more threads meant more instability. The culprit was the repeated calls to drawing and styling the map. My reasoning was that if I could reduce the number of calls to styling and drawing the map made by the mob threads, I could mitigate the styling bug.

Solution

The solution to the problem was to only make this call once for all currently on-screen mobs. This worked in minimising the effect of the styling bug.
