# Short werc tutorial

For a fuller guide see [werc.cat-v.org](http://werc.cat-v.org)

Your personal werc install is stored in `/var/www/werc3`, this is so you can radically alter the fundamental source code as you customize werc behaviour and not affect other werc installs

Unless stated otherwise, any mentions of `'/'` will refer to the starting point `/var/www/werc3`

## Werc apps

Apps themselves are all stored in `/apps`

The apps we will showcase on this domain are `bridge` (comments system), `dirdir` (in-house file interface) and `goralog` (blogging engine)

There are many other werc apps, [see here](http://werc.cat-v.org/apps) and more in development

### `bridge`

To see `bridge` in action visit the [updates](/updates) page


#### Blogging

The directory [blog](/blog) works as follows

### File permissions

Files must be owned by user 'www-data', otherwise apache2 cannot execute file deletion/creation.

If you manually create files/directories as the root user in your terminal, then you will run into server errors as you try to edit/save
