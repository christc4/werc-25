# Short werc tutorial

For a fuller guide see [werc.cat-v.org](http://werc.cat-v.org)

Your personal werc install is stored in `/var/www/werc3`, this is so you can radically alter the fundamental source code as you customize werc behaviour and not affect other werc installs

Unless stated otherwise, any mentions of `'/'` will refer to the starting point `/var/www/werc3`

## Werc apps

Apps themselves are all stored in `/apps`

The apps we will showcase on this domain are `bridge` (comments system), `dirdir` (in-house file interface) and `goralog` (blogging engine)

There are many other werc apps, [see here](http://werc.cat-v.org/apps) and more in development

### `bridge`

To see `bridge` in action visit the [updates](/updates) page

I set it up manually by

- `mkdir -p updates/_werc/comments && cd updates`
- `chmod 777 _werc/comments`
- `echo 'conf_enable_comments' > _werc/config`
- `touch index.md && chmod 777 index.md`

Lastly ensure everything is owned by user and group `www-data` you will learn why further on

`chown -R www-data:www-data updates/`

### `dirdir`

Your 'master' werc config in `/sites/b.bauherren.ovh/_werc`, [see](/_werc/config) feel free to look at other werc user's configs: [risingthumb](//risingthumb.xyz/_werc/config) and [cat-v](http://cat-v.org/_werc/config)

Files must be owned by user/group 'www-data', otherwise apache2 cannot execute file deletion/creation.

If you manually create files/directories as the root user in your terminal, then you will run into server errors as you try to edit/save

### `gallery`

This is a simple [gallery](gallery) it lists images, see its config [here](/gallery/_werc/config)
