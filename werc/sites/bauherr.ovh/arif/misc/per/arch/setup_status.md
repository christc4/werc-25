# Linux set-up logging

## Sorted

got firefox

got Hack font for st

got openssh



### Added - Needs configuring

startx - need to add some script to automate trivial tasks like connecting to internet with iwd. Also need to put in some kind of neat background maybe

sowm - window borders + transparency. Better macros for moving / resizing windows. Centering windows and giving it full screen.

st - changing font and background colours and stuff. Also make windows resizeable + fullscreen mode

lf - needs extending with scripts

Vim - syntax highlighting to be changed, need a colour scheme that works in both dark and light mode (maybe the one used in pariffin.org but with brighter orange)




#### Stuff to add

Backup system using git/github

xbacklight / brightnessctl - and to adjust with laptop macros

openvpn - 

browsers - already have firefox; maybe get chrome and brave. Also get relevant browser extenstions

Clipboard funtionality - Needs to be able to store images and screenshots too. Where browsers open file manager for opening purposes, add the option to take it from the clipboard.

touchpad functionality - may need to *revisit /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf*. Also need to add that circle that shows when pressing ctrl like in windows
Need to have infinity scroll when finger on edge of trackpad.

Need to add some sort of download manager like IDM, and then appropriate media players. 

Need to get comfortable with linux as well. Going to stick with defaults and not use much macros yet to learn the hard way.

Anime and stuff from terminal

Generalised search bar that can do multi purpose stuff. Maybe mapped to pressing super.
Need it to do niche stuff like calculating and small searches like definitions, synonyms

Probably libreoffice for excel stuff.

Cursor DPI control. Macro to switch between slow, default fast

Status icons for battery, volume, date + time, DPI setting

Better way to cycle through windows with alt tab

###### Other Arch notes

iwd - DNS stuff to set up on clean installs

Need to learn bash scripting
