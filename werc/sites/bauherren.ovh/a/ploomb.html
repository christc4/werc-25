<h2>What is plumbing?</h2>

<p>Plumbing is a mechanism for passing messages between applications. It has a customizable set of rules (see plumb(6)) to process incoming messages and dispatch them to target applications.

<p>The plumber(4) is the file server that performs the message processing and dispatch.

<p>It is up to each application how it wishes to use this mechanism, but in the user-interface domain, the mechanism often allows the user to point to a file-name or URL and have the associated resource processed by an appropriate application
