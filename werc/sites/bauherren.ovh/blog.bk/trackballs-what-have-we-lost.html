<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>If you've never gotten your feet wet with ergonomics, then the nitpicks and ramblings of this blog-post will sound totally inconsequential and best reserved for a hobbyist forum

<p>The goal of writing this is to convince you that the 'quirky' and 'novel' peripheral designs of long-ago actually have merit in computer ergonomics and efficiency, and aren't just historical curiosities to become viral in YouTube videos
<p>So as you read through consider the following words of advice 

<ul>
<li>Repetitive-most actions, should be allocated to and performed by one key
<ul><li>Single key-press as opposed to chord/layer</ul>
<li>With programmability, the possibilites are infinite
<ul><li>We're talking macro's, shortcuts, bindings etc.</ul>
</ul>
<h3>What did we lose and why?</h3>

<b>Media buttons</b>

<p>As <a href=http://xahlee.info/kbd>Xah Lee</a> puts it, media buttons were once in 'vogue' then fell out of fashion

<p>The Kensington Expert, used to sport 6 media buttons which could be assigned different functions

<p>Such genes weren't passed down to it's modern-day descendant

<p><b>Why have they disappeared?</b>

<p>The ''buttons'' were  hard to press and mushy like peas&hellip; 
<p>And&hellip; such was the case with many appearances of media buttons throughout out the '90s which saw them fall out of popularity quickly
<p>Any savings made would've no doubt been offset by a chorus of user complaints 

<p><b>Where were they good?</b>
<p>While not quite a trackball the Fujisu Spaceball's hosts <b>actual buttons</b>, which require extremely little activation force

<p><b>Taken to its logical conclusion...</b> more buttons are better?

<p>The Logitech G502 spin-wheel is simply the best, and if only it was possible to transplant it into other peripherals

<h3>Addendum</h3>

As briefly mentioned in the beginning, there are a dime-a-dozen tech review channels who do hit-and-run videos that only tangentially touch upon what is needed for a perfect trackball, unfortunately they never learn and the next week their videos are focused on reviewing the same stock devices with zero change to real-world computing efficiency

<h3>Christ-to-do</h3>

Compare buttons to dedicated keys on xkeys and esterline
