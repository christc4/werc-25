> Founded in 2002, _Jumma People's Network UK_ is committed to promoting the
> recognition, dignity, and equal rights of all humans as a foundation for peace and
> freedom.

We stand in solidarity with indigenous peoples worldwide, particularly the rights
of Jumma people in the Hill Tracts of Bangladesh (Rangamati, Khagrachari, and
Bandarban).

Our campaign focuses on preventing injustices and advocating for: civil,
political, socio-economic and cultural rights of indigenous communities both in
the Hill Tracts and abroad.

By exposing oppression and demanding action from governments and international
bodies, we seek to hold perpetrators accountable and ensure compliance with
international human rights laws.

We work to build a network of like-minded people and organizations, appealing to
global leaders to end human rights violations against minorities and indigenous
peoples.
