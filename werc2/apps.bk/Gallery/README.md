# gallery

Gallery is a simple werc app that overrides the default directory listing behaviour to list directories full of pictures in an image list rather than a bullet point list.

CSS not provided, but classes are included so you can style images how you want

## Installation and usage
- git clone this repository to your werc apps.
- Enable this app with the line `conf_enable_gallery` in your `_werc/config` file for the folder you want a gallery in.
- This will automatically list all images in that folder.
- This doesn't override the default header functionality. You can add some additional text for the page by editing `_header.md` in that folder.
