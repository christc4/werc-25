## Food

### Chickens

> I toyed with the idea of feeding chickens flies, collected with outdoor traps. I know some bugs are great for them, but flies carry too many diseases.

## Fuel

### Methane

Methane gas can be used for cooking.

Instructions,

- Fill with 1200 liters water
- Add cow manure
    - Provides an anaerobic environment for bacteria
- Add 1.5 gallons of food scraps per day.
    - Vegetable scraps or bones - the best inputs are starches
    - Bacteria breaks down this organic matter, creating natural methane
- Collect methane in top bag and route through carbon filter
    - This deodourizes it
- Pressurize gas through sandbags and install valve

### Wood

Can be used for heating the home.

> Chopping up old furniture or collecting thrown away pieces of wood is completely free. Insert image of wood you accumulated. Do not use green construction wood, that has been pressurised with chemicals.
