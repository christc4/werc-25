## <a name=contraception>Contraception</a>

Paraphrased from Fr. Josiah Trenham

God fashioned sexuality, the pleasure is so intense in order to justify the great burden of parenting

If you looked at a farmer and he took seed and he purposely threw it into the trees instead of the fields you'd think hes insane.

The fertile field is the maternal womb and can be an eternal being

Contraceptive sex is basically mutual masturbation, and it's like two dogs being in heat

## <a name=death-preparations>Death Preparations</a>

<s>I hit the kill switch before I see the lights, taking out with me avsbq.org and all its subdomains ~</s>

I like to think, I've briefed my friends enough, regarding the maintenance of my site/s... its upkeep, if it goes down etc. 

If they are incapable of being its caretaker, I'll probably come back to haunt them

I also like to think all of my belongings will be distributed to the right people/organisation's

## The long and dry

Okay turns out dying unexpectedly requires months of planning beforehand. Lot's of sundry things to do

Such as my most precious belongings and electronics, who do I have them distributed to? I need to make a document with *pictures* of my belongings

I need to also have my Priest notified.

Also extremely difficult to discuss the practical aspect with people you know, either they want to be -cryptic- and -cool- giving you stupid vampirish responses or are extremely shy and coy about the topic.

## <a name=great-font-shift>Great Font Shift</a>

I am not a font historian or connoisseur.

When I was still in school and looking through past-paper question bank I noticed the really-really old papers were all in serif font whereas anything post 2000 was in nice comforting sans-serif.

Was this a psychological ploy to ease exam-stressed students ? 

## <a name=fashionista-crime>Fashionista Crime</a>

Fashionista's do a lot of harm to the planet.

They do not understand 'timelessness', they try to revive a period of clothing they have no connection to, resurecting it and increasing the amount of clothes already in circulation, which will now be seen as outdated.

A lot of them who haven't studies classical tailoring proportions make clothes that don't fit well

Priceless or Worthless,

Lifeless or...

NOTE: Fashionista's far and large today are not continuing a long tradition of tailoring, they are incorporating wild and wacky ideas

Fashionistas will take something beautiful like this, forgetting the precise rules regarding armholes, length, etc, distort it, waste scarce resources and continue with themselves

## <a name=lovehoney>LoveHoney</a>

I never understood how scum this company was, more examples to come

Some time in early 2023, Got this email, from Student Beans a company that has codes for student discounts.

They are offering discounts for s&ast;x toys.

Love  honey was founded by two Brits, Neal Slateford and Richard Longhurst 

They are responsible for one in three s&ast;x toys sold in the UK - with one of their most popular being the 'Great American Challenge', a 32-inch dil&ast;o.

This email being sent out en-masse to university students.

Many kids create Google accounts with fake ages, this is probably harder now as Google uses id verification or they might be using someone elses account, and assume the ad offering free toys is referring to kids toys..

Provocative advertising campagins

Fortune favors the brave, saying attributed to Pliny the Elder before his expedition to Mount Vesuvius, both Pliny and his crew died. 


## <a name=phone-snatching>Phone Snatching</a>

Eastern Orthodox tradition goes that Lazarus, who was resurrected by Christ, never smiled during the thirty years following his resurrection, worried by the sight of unredeemed souls he witnessed during his four-day tenure in Hell. Yet when he sy someone stealing a pot, he smilingly said: "Clay steals clay".


I had the privilege to see the aftermath of not 1 but 2 phone-snatchings in the Olympic Park, East London.

The first time round, I was filld with immense rage towards the criminal even though I was neither the victim nor did I know him.

The second time around I felt completely apathetic. Why would I feel any anger? Someone stealing a tiny computer?

Will you see this as my patronage for villainy or see how phones are manmade and not worth getting angry about..

## <a name=rabbit-starvation>Rabbit Starvation</a>

Can you live a diet purely of rabbit meat?

From the [Jungle, Desert, and Arctic Emergencies Booklet 1941]

"Because of the importance of fats, under no conditions limit yourself to a meat diet of rabbit just because they happen to be plentiful in the region where you are forced down. A continued diet of rabbit will produce rabbit starvation -- diarrhea will begin in about a week and if the diet is continued DEATH MAY RESULT."

[Appian, Wars in Spain, CHAPTER IX]

> These noises caused strange terror in the Roman camp. Their soldiers were sick from want of sleep, and because of the unaccustomed food which the country afforded. They had no wine, no salt, no vinegar, no oil, but lived on wheat and barley, and the flesh of deer and *rabbits* boiled without salt, which caused dysentery, from which many died.
