### <a name=commute>Commute</a>

Person 1's route to work consists of lush gardens. Windows, purposefully, designed for maximum light. 

Person 2's traipses through  a sovietesque concrete jungle, there are no gardens, save for the weeds and lichens growing in pavement crack.

When I had to travel to college each and every day, I had the privilege of being more or less in Person 1's shoes. I got to take a leisurely stroll through the carefully maintained park grounds of Queen Elizabeth Olypmic Park each and every day. My peers, I assume had to board early commuter trains...

### <a name=mosquitos>Mosquitos</a>

When I visited Bangladesh, mosquito galore!

## How to prevent mosquito problem?

Kill at larval stage...

- drain/fill breeding site
- screening/covering water tanks
- dry out irrigation channel weekly, thus interrupting life-cycle of mosquito
- stock water sites with fish, which eat larvae, said fish can also be food source e.g. 'grass carp'

## religion

> "Jim Jones talks a lot about religion.  I never once heard him mention God."

My biggest disservice to the Christian faith was my 'freestyle' evangelism

I'd tell my younger self, to keep my mouth shut.

I haven't met the two, so I don't talk about Christian nearly as much as I used to

Lidis  didn't start appearing on German steins (German traditonal beermugs) until the Bubonic plague swept through Europe (in the 1300s), where insects appeared in their millions and were attracted to the sweet smelling beer. 

The government decreed that all drinking establishments had to cover their stoneware with lids to prevent spread of disease.

## Worthless

Not Priceless, Worthless. 

While sorting throgh an old bag of coins, and weeding out all the foreign ones. I jangled the metals in my hand.

Everything I'm holding in my palm is worthless. Utterly worthless.

In high-school economics, we were taught the four basic functions of money.

Money is a...

- Store of value
- Medium of exchange
- Unit of account
- Standard  of deferred payment

But wait... How could the people who created my course's specification forget the most important thing about money.

It's a religious belief.
