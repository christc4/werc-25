The unique ecology of a room lends itself to a mysterious species nesting there, the _smoke alarm_ whose songs are like Chinese water torture to the untrained ear...

The cycle of rebirth

todo This was a meme back in the 90's and early 00's, too. Especially on Loveline, the radio show where teens and young people called in to discuss relationship problems. The callers often had smoke detectors with low batteries periodically going off in the background. It was so common, Loveline had a reoccurring bit where one of the hosts would make the caller shut up so they could time the beeps and predict them. The host would often joke that a lizard in a cage would try to kill itself if it was subjected to the beeping, but their callers somehow managed to ignore it.

## <a name=coffee-naming-convention>Coffee Naming Convention</a>

<img src="/pub/pix/no-nonsense-coffee-guide.avif" style="width: 250px;">

I remember in my naive adolesence, I had decided to enter a coffee sshop for the first time and ask for a black coffee and the man behind the counter kept asking if I wanted an americano. Never had I felt so shocked, it was as if I had strutted their butt-naked apart from a tie, only to be revealed at the counter that the English I had learned for the past 18 years was no good here. Imagine the first ever person to be told his cold-hard cash is no good and it's a contactless store

After some internet sleuthing it seems that the term Americano originates from American G.Is stationed at Italy in WW2, whereby they'd dilute espresso with hot water

After some even more internet sleuthing it turns out [all americano is black coffee but not all black coffe is americano](https://qavashop.com/en/academy/Post/the-difference-between-americano-and-black-coffee), at this point I'm just gonna hang up my hat - I'm not a coffee connoisseur

### How the pros do it

This process is known as Arai Hari, 洗い張り,

_Stiching a kimono back into a tanmono, cleaning it drying it, cutting it and stictching it again..._

<img src="/pub/pix/araihari1.avif" style="width:310px;">

Before washing and starching kimonos, we check to see if the color will bleed and if the fabric is durable

<img src="/pub/pix/araihari2.avif" style="width:310px;">

All of the stitching on the kimono is removed

This is a time-consuming task as every last stitch must be removed

<img src="/pub/pix/araihari3.avif" style="width:310px;">

The unraveled kimono is sewn back together into a roll of fabric
At our shop, we use a special sewing machine to sew the edges

<img src="/pub/pix/araihari4.avif" style="width:310px;">

After the edges are sewn and the kimono is returned to its original shape, it is washed with a special detergent and a scrubbing brush

The temperature of the water and the amount of pressure used are adjusted depending on the kimono to remove dirt

<img src="/pub/pix/araihari5.avif" style="width:310px;">

The washed cloth is dehydrated and hung outside to dry

<img src="/pub/pix/araihari6.avif" style="width:310px;">

The washed rolls of fabric are re-sewn to fit the width of the work area
At this time, any frayed edges are re-sewn

<img src="/pub/pix/araihari7.avif" style="width:310px;">

Shinko-bari

For rolls of tsumugi fabric, bamboo sticks with needles on the ends are stretched over the fabric, and wrinkles are smoothed out using the flexibility of the bamboo

As the sticks are stretched at 2cm intervals, approximately 600 sticks are used on one roll of fabric 

<img src="/pub/pix/araihari8.avif" style="width:310px;">

A natural paste is applied to the stretched cloth with a brush
The thickness of the paste is adjusted according to the quality of the fabric and the season, so this requires years of experience

<img src="/pub/pix/araihari9.avif" style="width:310px;">

Dry the roll of fabric with the starch applied
As it dries slowly with the fabric stretched, any wrinkles will disappear

<img src="/pub/pix/araihari10.avif" style="width:310px;">

For crepe cloth, the width of the fabric is adjusted by applying steam using a machine called a tenter

<img src="/pub/pix/araihari11.avif" style="width:310px;">

The finished cloth is rolled up on a board, laid flat, and bound with thread before being washed and hung

## <a name=lululemon>LuLuLemon</a>

Wilson said he picked the name Lululemon because he thought the difficulty Japanese people had pronouncing the letter 'L' was an extra marketing tool for the product in the country, stating, “It's funny to watch them try and say it.

## <a name=x61s-down>x61s DOWN!</a>

I broke a x61s motherboard today. Let's frame everything I did wrong in a constructive manner so you can learn from my idiocy. I'll start by recreating the crime scene.

## Crime scene

<img src=/pub/pix/x61s-5.avif style="width: 200px;">

What am I looking at you ask? Well to put it short, that black wire you see crawling on the screen? That's connected to the power jack in the bottom right corner and, which I didn't bother checking at the time. I hooked it up to the speaker port in the top left corner. What was the outcome of that. My friend and I got a very nice light show (sparks on the board and some transistors got fried).

<img src=/pub/pix/x61s-2.avif style="width: 200px;">

Here's a close up.

## Why I did that

<img src=/pub/pix/x61s-1.avif style="width: 200px;">

Do you see that red and black cable tucked away next to the RAM? Yep, that's the speaker plug, it's been donkeys-years since I hid it there. I didn't want it bumping around and I wasn't using the speaker at the time so it seemed the most convenient place.

<img src=/pub/pix/x61s-3.avif style="width: 200px;">

Here's what it's supposed to look like on another board I owned.

<img src=/pub/pix/x61s-4.avif style="width: 200px;">

And that black wire? It's meant to hook up to a bluetooth card.

Funny thing is just before all this unfolded. My friend called my McGyve style SSD removal genius. Here's a tip to removing a SSD if you don't have a caddy the with pull tab, get some tape and jimmy it up there, double sided on some thin plastic works. Or if you're tape is really-really strong you can just tap it on the SSD and pull.

Well, you shouldn't throw genius around liberally, I had 2 spare x61s motherboards with me and I could have done a quick web search to see what that black cable even was.

Anyways lesson learned. I hope I've framed my blunder in a constructive manner. Don't operate on guesswork, only toddlers plug random things in.

And I'll probably only mention in hushed tones now that I used to repair ThinkPadsfor a lving during 2020-2022

Anyways its got a compromised bios
