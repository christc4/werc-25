Can you actually ''love'' a city?

If  your soil becomes infertile and your rivers start to dry, your way of life goes belly-under.

Whereas in an urban environment, as long as you are geographically close to your work/school and economically 'safe' - you are more or less fine.

If your city is full of betting shops on every corner and societal ills creep into everyones way of life, as long as the above two criterion are met - again you are 'fine'.

Your stake in the city isn't tied down to the environment, ever see a most polluted cities list?

## <a name=college-obseervations>College Observations</a>

An interesting phenemonom studying English-Literature.

I asked all of my English Literature teachers, one had PhD, one studied at Oxford, other at Cambridge and teaches at the prestiguous Eton college, have they ever published book/poem or if I can read their writings that are not essays on other peoples work.

They all said no and one teacher said very coyly, she is a poet but it's personal and she would feel embarassed sharing.

That's interesting, a lot of poets or authors, they wanted their work to be burned by a friend upon their death, instead their friend marvelling about their work gets it published and so many years later we end up studying it under an academic lens..

<hr>

What I find even more fascinating, is that as my eyes crawled through some of the books we studied, it felt like a stream of consciousness of a deadman, is being injected into me, and so I started committing passing phrases, wordy english words to memory, writing them down. Instead of analysing it and breaking it down, I filled my spare pages, with beautiful paragraph openings and sentence types. I felt so compelled to write afterwards.

Maybe this is why I got a B, after sitting the exam two-times

## <a name=eden>Eden</a>

Christ is the only exit from this world. All other exits - sexual rapture, political utopia, economic independence - are but blind alleys in which rot the corpses of many who have tried them- Fr. Seraphim Rose

It's trivial for God to reveal secrets such as new technology or other secrets and cause insane price disturbances and throw the whole world into complete chaos - Terry Davis

If you lived in an edenic world, and every waking moment was picture-perfect what would drive you to write poetry, sculpt or paint.

Look at the level of sculpture in the hadzabe's dolls they make for their kids..

Math is a playground, God gave humans to keep us from being bored

All art is applied mathematics,

If you are anti exercise most people are equipped with extreme tunnel vision and will immediately shut you down as a couch potato. More often than not, those people are simply 'using' exercise to get out of whatever rut they're in - they're not actually doing anything. There are countless peoples in the exercise annals who had to explain what exercise was, it was so unheard of to people

Treadmills torture device the guy who populrised running?

Isn't exercise is natural

A lot and a lot of people appeal to the fact humans are hunter-gatherers but what's lost on a lot of people is the type of hunting people used to do. Most hunting revolves around:

- lurking
- marksmanship
- tracking

occasionally you would run to your prey,

People also have backwards what is sedentary, walking long distances in a non-exertive fashion should be classed as sedentary, walking with your baby strapped to you many miles is also sedentary.

Bodybuilding

Trying to get through to a body bulider is like trying to get through a brick wall

 Bodybuilding is ''natural''

Many erroneously equate bodybuilding to one of man's ''primal'' urges, such as rock-lifting... Why wwould a human exert, kill their cells, to lift rocks in nature? To attract other men. Most lifting in nature would be animal carcasses, and even then... Large game would be collectively carried by you and your kin.

There is nothing natural to wolf, scarf, shovel down large quantiities of your 'catch' to gain muscles.

## <a name=lao-tzu>Lao Tzu</a>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 80

"A small country has fewer people.

Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than man, they are not needed.

The people take death seriously and do not travel far.

Though they have boats and carriages, no on uses them.

Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them.

Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.

Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure;

They are happy in their ways.

Though they live within sight of their neighbors,

And crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,

Yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die."
