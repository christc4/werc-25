## <a name=bespoke-bd>Bespoke in Bangladesh</a>

Suits aren't a thing in Bangladesh.

Bengali's don't know suits. The British know suits. The Italians and Japanese know suits.

That's not to say there aren't talented tailoring houses dotted around the capital - well... in the well-to-do areas. 

You have to be ultra-specific and you're better talking to an older and more-travelled tailor.

Make sure they don't use any fusing or glue in the construction, go for a pure cotton no blended synthetics.

My childhood in London's -East End-.

On the 12th of August 2024, I read Simon Webb's marvelous book, -A 1960s East End Childhood- to which many of my glamarous assumptions of that era were dispelled.

I'd like to give an account for what *my* childhood was like in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Dislocation from what people remember and what history rremembers

Memories deteriorate and I assume this will undergo many revisions until I'm satisfied I've given an exact and honest account...

## The years 2008 to ... 2015

My Mother worked in Jaypharm Chemist in Brayford Square, Shadwell and my Father	worked each day at a care home for the elderly.

This meant that during summer holidays, I was to stay with Mom at her work. A chemists is hardly a play environment for a child so I was stowed away in a little back room, like a castaway but that area was where my imagination could spill out onto paper 

I would have sheets of paper in which I'd fill to the brim with stickmen warring against each other. There were 2 factions and I'd split the page with a pen marking for borders. Its a good thing the law of physics didn't apply to my battlegrounds because the weapons were often horribly disproprortionate to the stickmens frame vut often well thought of if K do say so myself.

My mother would eventually buy me these cheap plastic army men for me to play with that the Chemist conveniently sold,

This would come to an end more or less one day when a fellow worker saw me in there when theyd went in to bring back something. He made a comment to my Mother about how it wasn't appropriate for me to be there, to which she agreed and I was free to explore the square 

This new rite of freedom, I soon realised wasn't all it was chalked up to be.

## <a name=high-school>High School</a>

Although, I'm a native-speaker of English, anytime I hear an interesting word/phrase/quote/idiom I instantly record it. Don't just make a mental note of it.

When, I was studying GCSE English-Literature, our teacher drilled into our heads the concept of &apos;reading&apos; to mine good-sounding phrases and words - so as to boost the level of our writing. In principle this is good but &ndash; left as is &ndash; is completely idiotic. A good English teacher would immediately recognise the need to extend this to all factors of communication to: daily, written, informal and formal speech.

Hardware

I use what I guess you'd call a &apos;headless&apos; laptop,

<img src="/pix/headless-x230-01.avif" style="width: 250px;">

It's the motherboard of a corebooted ThinkPad x230

It is quite an exhibitionist... And I've now elevated it for better airflow.
Sidenote: Laptops with their motherboards encased feels like leaving your child in a locked car on a sweltering hot day :)

The two lowest common denominators that act as friendships' glue is

> utility + satisfaction

### Burn a bridge or drain a swamp?

Can you salvage a friendship built on locker-room talk? Maybe, but it'll be the shortest-burning candle to ever candle.

### Software Philosophy

When you can no longer see the forest for the trees. When the artisans, hobbyists and tinkerers move out and the industrialists, contracters, men in suits step in, I generally step out

### Hardware philosophy

I don't expect my hardware to conk out anytime soon

I give London a months top beforee everyone goes feral

My friend [pariffin](//pariffin.org) says...

`the ppl in the countryside moved to the countryside to begin with because urban life was basically the same as living with zombies to them from the start
