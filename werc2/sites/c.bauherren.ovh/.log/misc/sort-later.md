CHINESE CHARACTERS WERE ONCE EXTREMELY LOGICAL... LONG AGO

Look at these symbols

Imagine, you live in an uncontacted tribe and the concept of 'sharing a file' or 'contactless payment' is beyond your brain. Maybe, a smart member of the tribe, could see what these symbols represent, perhaps llikening the waves to a ripple in water, or the share dots as links, or the arrows as a continuation of something.

But for the most part, these symbols are more about memorisation than understanding.

_redacted_ says,

`I don't see how it's unintuitive. The icon is an undirected graph where each node is a person, and each edge denotes a sharing action`

Maybe you can think conceptually like _redacted_

For me it looks like two vintage dumbbells

The chinese character 人at face-value looks just like a banana peel to me

## <a name=clothes-thrifting>Clothes Thrifting</a>

Some thrifht because it is more economic, which this isnt addressing

others subscribe to lofty ides, think  they are fighting the big man fast fashion like how some people try stick it to big gpharma

the holy grails of thrifting are most often from a bygone era you have no connection to, 

not to mention the numerous anatomical quirks you possess, 

thrifting is good at removing clothes from cirucaliton

but to stick it to fasst fashion is to breathe life into bespoke tailorings

## Should you buy an old ThinkPad?

- Is your computer usage processor intensive?
	- Video rendering, compilation, Triple A gaming?
	- go away

- Do you only edit documents, read emails and watch YouTube?
	- Then probably

- Are you worried about your laptop being stolen?
	- If yes, and you answered no to the first question. Then probably.

- Do you know what you are doing?
	- Then buy.

- Do you know or care about coreboot/libreboot?
	- If no to both, don't buy.

But I can have two machines! I can have my main rig kitted out for all the heavy lifting! And I can have a ThinkPad be my rugged retainer!

Go away.

### Even shorter answer

Unless you are a tinker willing to part with his time, don't bother.
I'd recommend keeping your eyes peeled on devices like the Framework laptop

## Back to wordy blog&hellip;

ThinkPads&hellip; the classic fixer-upper that you'll shell hundreds of dollars into - to get it even comparable to a modern machine. Or is it?

As someone whose primary work, for a year, was reparing and reselling ThinkPads - I sort of have a position. Mind you, I'm out of the loop when it comes to current market prices but I can give my 2 cents. As per the title, this is going to tackle the subject of _old_ ThinkPads, what qualifies as _old_ - I'll say anything pre x240 era.

Say you're in the market for a *used* ThinkPad, we're gonna need to establish a long list of things.

1. Are you willing to learn new things?
    - Are you the person who is grossed out by the nipple? Unwilling, to learn a lighter operating system like Linux or BSD? Expecting. Learn to repair and swap parts?
    - If you're in the camp that says _X is only cheap, if your time is valueless_ then ThinkPads are not for you.

2. Are you prepared to deal with issues sourcing batteries?
    - Genuine OEM batteries are rarer by the day, as soon as you see one listed - snag it asap - as long as the price is reasonable.

# Buying experience

If you aren't buying direct from an enthusiast, you'll most likely be temporarily lumbered with someone's clunky old machine - shelved for eternity - if you hadn't bid on it. ThinkPads can be cheap as chips depending how you go about this.

Keycaps may be mirror-y,

Thought experiment

If a thinkpad is replaced part by part is it still the same ThinkPad?

ThinkPad on its last legs?
So what happens eventually when software becomes too bloated you can't run it? Home server?

ThinkPads are good for what they are.

Ideas Have Consequences 

Various bloggers and article writers have done an excellent job of laying out the many mistakes of Stanford professor Paul Ehrlich, whom CBS recently devoted a segment to on “60 Minutes.”

So I won’t bother to repeat their cogent criticisms.

Yesterday I went to the Wall Street Journal to see a letter by my friend and economist colleague Francois Melese in which he took on Ehrlich. It’s an excellent letter. Then I read one of the other letters and felt profoundly sad for the writer, Kenneth Emde of Woodbury, Minnesota.

Emde wrote:

I was a college student when I read Mr. Ehrlich’s “The Population Bomb.” I took it to heart and now have no grandchildren, but 50 years later the population has increased to eight billion without dire consequences. I was gullible and stupid.
