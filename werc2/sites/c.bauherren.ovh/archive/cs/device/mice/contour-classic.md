#### Should you buy it?

If you find this cheap, say under fifteen pounds then buy.

### Negatives

Scroll wheel. See my rant on mice scroll wheel, [here](https://avsbq.org/blog/rant/scroll_wheel). To cut it short any mice that doesn't have a scroll wheel on par with the Logitech G502 - it's usability instantly falls in half for me.

### Positives

THREE BUTTON MICE. Of course, almost all modern mice the scroll wheel functions as a middle button when clicked. It's just nice to treat the middle button the same as its siblings.

Very nice clicks.

### Overall

I use the acme text editor a lot, that's why I love this mouse.
