# Review of Postal Services

Stop. Please recommend me a fast and reliable international shipping service from the UK.

## Evri

2024/04/26, 22:46, for the past few weeks Evris people have been delivering incredibly late hours of the night, completely idiotic . The apartment I am currently in (2024), has a sign that says do not leave items downstair Evri either exclusively hires from the illiterate.

2024/04/27, Evri again chose midnight delivery, the cream on top was how they delivered a parcel belonging to someone from a completely different building to us, this has happened multiple times and usually results in me having to manually trace the rightful parcel owner

Talk about h ow the driveer failed to collecw microwave and when he came to drop of another item, he then finally saw on his phone the pickup scthediel



thi is  is highly dependant on how compotent and how willing the &apos;extra mile&apos; he will walk

### Evri international

Whatever domestic courier they work with must operate at a snail's pace. Will never use again.

## Royal Mail

Has lost numerous items sent with 2nd class, if its of any importance use 24 hour or 48 hour track.d

### Royal Mail international

Same problem as Evri international, arrived month and half late, was urget document. DO NOT USE.

### Yodel

Delivered item at completely wrong building across the street


## Sendico

Fantastic
