*Why is there a warning 'Reduce speed now'?*

There's a crossroads and a double bend ahead. You'll see a sign warning you to slow down when you're approaching a part of the road where you need to be especially careful. For example, as you approach a roundabout, a crossroads or a bend. If you're travelling on a major road and coming up to a junction with a minor road, you should slow down - even if you don't want to turn. This is because another driver at the junction may not be able to see clearly and they could pull out in front of you.



*Why has the line in the centre of the road changed?*

To warn of hazards ahead. The broken white line marks the boundary between lanes on your side of the dual carriageway. But when the lines start to lengthen, with shorter gaps, this warns you of a hazard coming up - like a sharp bend.

*The driver towing the caravan wants to turn right onto the dual carriageway. What should they do?*

Wait until the road is clear in both directions before turning
