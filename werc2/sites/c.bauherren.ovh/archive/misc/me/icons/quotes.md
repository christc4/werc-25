## On hating things

> Slightly paraphrased from Fr. Paul Truebenbach, https://youtu.be/nRPbmwJedxI?si=OMsCMC4xQlMndRMS

"We will never succeed in this fight against lust if men fight against lust and against the demon of lust in doing so all you do is get into a conversation with him and guess what? He is much smarter, much more experienced than you in the fight. He is going to make you fall. What you have to do is want something more than you want lust. You have to fight for a purity you want more. You have to fight for Christ. You have to fight for the spiritual life. You have to fight for all these things, for your family. You have to find the things that you're fighting for more than you're fighting against lust. And if those become a greater motivator for you... and you refuse the devil's despair. Then you'll victory in this eventually. ...It takes time but that time really does tie in with the spiritual life when they become better Christians and better men because of it"

The elder monk said, wait here, I shall be first. The elder monk came to prostitute and said, here, take this coin, soon a young man will come after me, do what i tell you and refuse him. The prostitute agreed. When the elder came out of brothel, he told the young monk - now you go. The young monk came before the prostitute, and before anything happened, the prostitute said - wait, there are rules even here. We must both do 50 prostrations, and then we may proceed. Both the young monk and the prostitute started prostrating, when they reached about 20 or 30, the young monk said - I cannot worship before the sin. And the young monk rushed out. The two monks returned to their monastery, and God had removed the lust from the young monk. Do the prostrations before the sin, and the demons shall flee. (Source Unknown)

I have discovered that when I confess it, that is, when I remove the rocks, the weeds, the briars, and so on, it then produces healthy vegetables; otherwise the tomatoes are yellowish and stickly!". - St. Paisios, Spiritual counsels III
