I have a bit of experience with plan9, actually! I installed it on bare metal on my t420 for a couple weeks just to play with some of the utils and C. Another example I found was the fact that ls didn't columnate by default, but there was a different program, mc, which does columnate. Then I learned lc (ls piped into mc) was provided on the system, and realized that separating the small functionality like that allowed any program to be in column format if wanted! The names might be wrong as this was a couple years ago, however the situation itself happened for me. Good job rp!

use the word "in effect" in your essay
jklowden on April 11, 2016 | prev [–]

I wrote to Kernighan a few years ago, when "D is for Digital" came out, to ask him, in effect, if troff had been made obsolete by TeX. At the time I had begun using it, and wondered if it was worth investing my time to learn.

He answered that he still preferred to use troff, having tried alternatives. Since then I have used groff exclusively for writing documentation and papers. It never runs out of gas, and always produces attractive output. It offers a complete suite -- math, tables, pictures, graphs -- all in one package. It's fast, adaptable, and easy to learn. It has the highest ratio of text to markup of any typesetting system, including TeX and Markdown. It is the single most overlooked and under appreciated project on the planet.

Whether it's had "significant" development in the past 10 years depends on what that means. Current groff produces PDF format directly, without a Postscript intermediary. The PDF macros support links and TOC generation. I think that all took place in the last few years.

I don't have to use plan9 to value what the 9fans did.

I don't have to use plan9 to secure the benefit of exploring models of software, systems, networks which plan9 explored.

I think that you have to swim very strongly across some currents, to decide to "be" in plan9, but its no different in that sense to choosing to live behind a Nokia brick phone, or only using pen and paper in meetings. Others may work effectively in their kanban on a laptop, but the decision to stop using the parts of your brain which type, and instead use the parts of your brain which shape semantic intent, by writing, is quite large.

And in that sense, deciding to use plan9, or even just a tiling window manager, or to disable image load in web by default, or to use Markdown or Org mode to do thing instead of reaching for some packaged electron app, or to focus on GO or Haskell or whatever the thing is, which forces you to think about what you are doing in code, That decision may be swimming against the stream, but its big.

Plan9 is big. Its not for everyone, and I decided not to invest because it had moving parts I didn't feel confident I understood and at the time I looked at it, was wedded to multiple independent instances of boxes I didn't own.

Now, it is probably entirely possible inside containers or VMs or something, but I am content to know I could.

(I am however, using pen and paper more in meetings)

2. POSIX way of doing sed -i:
$ create temporary file (mktemp is not in POSIX, POSIX ways of creating temp files is to use noclobber or mkdir -m 700 with randomly generated name)
$ sed '...' file > temp_file
$ mv temp_file file

3. I recommend creating that temporary file in the same folder - not in /tmp etc.  Reason for this is that mkdir and mv (when both input and output paths are on the same filesystem) are the only atomic filesystem operations.  If we create temp file in /tmp and then do `mv` it might do `rename` internally or it might become `cp + rm` combo - and cp is not atomic.
Example:
$ create temp_file
$ sed '...' file > temp_file
$ cp temp_file file
This way might leave you with damaged file if you stop cp in the middle of copying.  mv (if and only if both input and output paths are on the same filesystem) turns into `rename` which is atomic and this guarantees us ACID - our file will never get corrupted, it will either get updated completely or not at all.
