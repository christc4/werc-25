For every solution-ist worth their salt there are a dime-a-dozen if not more agitation people - who rile up their audiences leaving them in a frenzied state over often inconsequential and sometimes faraway events

Georgi Plekhanov, dubbed the father of Russian Marxism, believed propagandists present many ideas to _one or a few people_ whereas agitators present only one or a few ideas to a _mass of people_ 

To which he describes agitation using 'slogans and half-truths' and 'exploited public grievances' to mould public opinion and mobilise support

Lenin explained in a 1902 pamphlet, _What Is to be Done_,  his beliefs on the role of the propagandist and agitator

- Propagandists work with media
- Agitators, for their part, act on emotional levels, rousing people to take an interest in social ills

Agit-prop lives on from soviet-times, its spiritual descendents being the numerous political pundits littering your feed after any major politicism whose long-winded rants while sometimes dropping pithy remarks only tangentially touch on 'possible' solutions. 

### Addendum

So agitation propaganda really is like casting spells onto the masses, the spells being hard-coded signals to your anger receptors. Rule by rumourville
