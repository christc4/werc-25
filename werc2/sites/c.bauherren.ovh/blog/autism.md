Being on the 'verge, brink and edge' are scenarios you'd be hardpressed to find a low-functiioning autist stay in

Autists are fine-tuned to be super-sensitive to stimuli, too much will overwhelm their senses.

Where autists differ with their non-autistic brethren is the freshhold of stimuli one can tolerate before thrasing/fleeing

Domesticated man is adapted in the sense, he can tolerate, aclimatize and justify why he willingly remains in stressful environments 

Yet, his counterpart is very much more immune to any coaxing

Lack of stimuli also provokes autistic persons. They will exit a boring classroom

To seek the pathhood of least resistance is acceptable for one and lazy for another
