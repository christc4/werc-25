Being on the 'verge, brink and edge' are scenarios you'd be hardpressed to find a low-functiioning autist stay in

Autists as we all know are super sensitive to stimuli, too much will overwhelm their senses.

Where autists differ with their non-autistic brethren is the freshhold of stimuli one can tolerate before thrasing/fleeing

Domesticated man is adapted in the sense, he can tolerate, aclimatize and perhaps even justify why he willingly chooses to remain  in a stressful environment. Of course, _rational_ man is acutely aware of the push and pull factors

Yet, his counterpart is much more immune to such coaxing

_So why state the obvious?_

Lack of stimuli will also provoke an autistic person. They will exit a boring classroom

It is viewed 'normal' for an autist to seek the path of least resistance because they are 'special' but if _rational_ man  was to do the same they would face a lot of criticism

Due to how society is structured, it is and cannot be Edenic, humans had to apopt non-autistic traits

Autism is the default state of mankind. Autistic people are closer to bearing the same scent animals smelled upon Adam in the Garden
