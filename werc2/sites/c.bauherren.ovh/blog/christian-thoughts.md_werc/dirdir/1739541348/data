## Don't get in conversation with the demon/devil


<img src=/pix/demon-speech-bubble.avif>

They are crafty and will hold your hand leading you to explore and theorize sinful fantasies

shrewd not wise

Cling to your prayer rope

The demons will walk you down the same path you've walked a hundred times before

## Baptism

After the spiritual surgery has taken place true rebellion is an idea now attainable

## Unsorted

We betray each other at the drop of a hat.

We see the wounds on the risen Christ, where he was pierced with nails. 

But the wounds in our brethren we are oblivious to.

## Math, Art and the Sciences 

2024/12/27

Before I used to think, did God really create such a wondrous universe as his plaything, if death is guaranteed, why allow man to reach great scientific heights? Why does such a powerful God allow us to excel in the arts and sciences, for his glory?

My personal opinion is that God gave us those things as a playground, and the beauty we decode from studying sciences by nature glorifies him.

## Pornography and the Sin of Self Abuse

2024/12/27

I used to deride others. Each streak of abstinency, I commemorated with boasting and jeering. And each time I was humbled.

The immense backlog of internet pornography and fantasies we've cultivated in our minds, is not enough to satisfy man.

That is why, we comission the demons. We toss fresh souls onto the barbecue spit, onto the funeral pyre. 

Our fantasies guide us into the tailor's shop, where we outfit the next generation of pornstars, and whether it's our wallets or attention we comission the demons.

We spur pornstars on, as they take part in the Devil's marathon. Each view, each click. 

But, as the Church and Her infinite wisdom teaches us. 

> _"Let them not perish because of me a sinner"_

Let us atone, with prayer.

As St. Paul himself said,

> _"I am the worst of sinners"_

So too are we, but unlike Judas who dropped out of the marathon through confession let us re-enroll.

And pray for the numerous victims of pornography, let us no longer carry or cheer them in the Devil's marathon but through tearful prayer beg they are grafted into the marathon which is salvation.
