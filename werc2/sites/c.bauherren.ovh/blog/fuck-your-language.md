Centuries of medieval scholasticism, academic rigor, cultural revolutions have rendered many words,  _utterly useless_ 

Words can [1]

- encompass a totality/particular
- be vehicles for concepts
- have one or many referrants

Words have become so useless, we need to _justify_ invoking them in discussion

_"it's X, in the sense that..."_

At the end of the day, words mean what the 'brokers of power' aka round-table intelligentsia want them to be

Words have been boiled down to their lowest common denominator, refrosted - deforested

Think of these 'sounds' as a rolling ball of bubblegum, which continuously gets new things tacked onto it
