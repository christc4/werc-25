Growing up I associated lard as something pre WW2 or essential to the insult 'lardass'.

My local cornerstore, the shopkeep and his two assistants looked at me like I was speaking greek.

To my surprise, it was right in front of me. When I point it out, they went ohhh its butter.

In the co-operative, the man stocking the shelves had no idea and thought I meant chocolate, after I spelled it out and told him its used in cooking, everyones ears in the queue perked up and a kind English lady told  me they wont have it and to go to the store down the road

### Addendum

This belies a greater illness
