Offloading parenting is the transferral of fatherly/motherly duties onto others - like 'outsourcing'

> _"When you move internal operations to a 3rd party"_

## Scenario 1

A father doesn't pass on to his son, his worldview

Young and impressionable, he becomes enraptured by an online persona

Label said wellspring of motiivation as whatever, no matter how true it often rings null and void

## Scenario 2 (More applicable)

Children have a  natural affinity to games

You don't have to do your homework on the latest triple A titles

Knowing about roleplaying, board, RTS doesn't hurt

Forgoing any bonding experience always leaves room for an online community to step in










The passing on of the parental torch is a delicate operation and the utmost care must be taken :))
