The Boomerang is a craftable Ranged Weapon. It requires 1 Boards, 1 Silk, and 1 Charcoal to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

The Boomerang returns to the player after being thrown. The player must catch it by holding down the action key (default Space key) while it is on its way back. If it isn't caught after being thrown, it will hit the player, causing damage and losing twice the durability on return, and the player will have to pick it up from the ground in order to use it again.

Abigail heals 1hp per second. Healing items which are NOT food (e.g. spider glands and healing salves) can be used on her to heal manually. There are two potions wendy can make which can temporarily increase abby's healing. Revenant Restorative triples her health regen rate up to 3hp/second for one full day.1 Nov 2020
