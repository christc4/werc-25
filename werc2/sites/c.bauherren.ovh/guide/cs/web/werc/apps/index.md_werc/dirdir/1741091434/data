These are werc apps I am involved in maintaining/contributing to, I try provide enough documentation in case it can be used as someone's trail of rope

If you've never used werc and are interested I've written a [guide](../)

## apps

[dirdir](dirdir): _now_ a feature-rich wiki thanks to [risingthumb.xyz](//risingthumb.xyz) and slowly I

[lang](lang): translation/language-learning tools

[misc](misc): not strictly an app but useful for interfacing with them

[search](search): search through files, filenames (included sitemap)

### lesser apps


[glenda](glenda): like cowsay but with [glenda](http://glenda.cat-v.org)
[lights](lights): toggle on/off dark-theme
[colors](colors): visualize CSS colors


#### to-do
