Your 'master' werc config is stored in your site's home directory `$site/_werc`,

Look through some different people's site configs

- [mine](/_werc/config)
- [risingthumb](//risingthumb.xyz/_werc/config)
- [cat-v](http://cat-v.org/_werc/config)

Files must be owned by user/group 'www-data', otherwise apache2 cannot execute file deletion/creation.

If you manually create files/directories as the root user in your terminal, then you will run into server errors as you try to edit/save
