# 被

被 expresses passive voice in Chinese.

In passive sentences, the _object_ of an action becomes the _subject_ of the sentence, and the _"doer"_ of the action, which would have been the subject of the normal (active voice) sentence, becomes secondary and may or may not be mentioned in the pasive sentence. 


被 is the most common way to crreate the passive verb form

- 男孩吃了热狗	
	- active voice\* "热狗" is the _object_ of the verb "吃"
- 热狗被男孩吃了
	- "热狗" is now the subject and "男孩" is the doer
- 热狗被吃了
	- passive voice with the doer "男孩" completely omitted

## Why use them

Indicate that one has been negatively affected

他被打了

Secondly, passive sentences shift emphasis from the action's  doer to the one affected by that action.

- 你被公司炒鱿鱼了?
	- 炒鱿鱼 (coll. to be fired)

Third, passive sentences allow one to avoid having to mention the "doer" of the action. Maybe they're unknown or for other reasons

我的手机被偷了

## How to use 被

Normal use of 被 has a few preconditions:

- The verb to be used with 被 needs an object (this becomes the new subject of the 被sentence) Verbs that take objects are called transitive verbs
- If you're going to state who the verb was done by (the doer), then the subject doing the original action must be known
- The verb can't be too simple (for example, a one-character verb like 吃). Put simply, the verb needs to come after the verb. That "something"  can  be a particle like 了, a complement, or sometimes even an additional object.


*Structure*

Subj. + 被 (+ Doer) + Verb + 了

*Examples*

被 sentences *with* a doer:

- 我被他骗了
- 他被警察抓了
- 他被父母骂了

被 sentences *without* a doer:

- 我的车被撞了
- 他们做的坏事被发现了
- 文件被删了
