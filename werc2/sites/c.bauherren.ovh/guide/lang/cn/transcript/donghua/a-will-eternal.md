师兄最近真是清闲 | Brother has been really free lately

还有心思来我紫鼎山下棋 | Still have the heart to come to me in ziding mountain to play chess

修士心性 | Monk's mind

本该如此 | It should be like this

可惜师兄的逍遥总是短暂 | It's a pity that my brother's freedom is always short lived

俗缘一日未了| Secular fate has yet to end

免不得东奔西走 | Unavoidable running around

说起那段俗缘 | Speaking of that secular fate

着实让我头痛 | It really gives me a headache

当年李某受恩于人 | Back then, Li was indebted to someone

承诺其后人以黑香传信便可收做门徒 | Promised that his descendants could become his disciples if they sent a message with black incense

但这三年里 | But for the past three years

传信之烟不断引我去寻 | The incense keeps leading me to seek

每次刚有眉目| Everytime just about to materialize

又立即断灭 | It will be extinguished

实在可恨 | Really detestable
