The bottom wood was notoriously hard to sand down, I'd recommend using bits of furniture

I used mod-podge, I'm sure there are better alternatives, I've had no problems with it, I will say it's extremely fast-drying</p>

Sand your block of wood, start with low to medium to fine grit. Wrap your sanding paper around another block of wood, to make things easier for yourself.

Since these are holy images, even if they are prints, treat them with respect, if you make a failed attempt ask your priest on how to properly dispose of it.

Make sure i run imagemagick, on my failed reverse one to show the people how it should look

You may ask why did I paint it black?
Well, I haven't perfected the "scrubbing" technique, removing the paper, requires patience, so more than often, if you scrub with your fingers too hard or over the same area too many times, while still wet, you will pull the adhered paper. Black isn't the best colour, especially for an Orthodox icon.
