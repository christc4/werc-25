## Headlights

*Dipped headlights*

They're named as such because the beam faces down towards the road.

They are brighter than sidelights and daytime-running lights, but less bright than full beam headlights

As dipped headlights point down, they don't illuminate the road ahead as well as full-beam headlights. But that means they don't shine in the eyes of road users coming towards you.

The Highway Code says you must use dipped headlights at night and when "visibility is seriously reduced". This is generally considered when visibility is restricted to 100 metres or less.
