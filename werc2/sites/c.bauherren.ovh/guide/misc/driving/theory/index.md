# Driving Theory Notes

##Multiple choice:

*Resources:*
- List of common traffic signs: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-highway-code/traffic-signs (see pdf)
- Pelican, Puffin, and Toucan crossings: https://www.theorytestadvice.co.uk/learn-to-drive/crossings.php
- Some road markings: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/know-your-traffic-signs/road-markings (does not cover single and double yellow lines)
- Better summary of road markings: https://driving-test-success.com/road-lane-markings.htm



*General advice:*
Fastest way to learn multiple choice is simply brute forcing through all the pra
ctice questions on some mobile app (there's around 700-800 of them as of September 2024).
See the common trafic signs and road markings too: some questions will ask about them.
It's basically common sense combined with knowledge of road markings and traffic signs, and other car specific stuff for the most part.


*Notes:*

If something along the lines of "Be prepared to stop" is one of the options, it is almost always the right answer.

Full headlights are so that you can see. Dipped headlights are so drivers can see you.

Because the driving test is about ensuring safety for both you and other drivers, the answers will almost always be dipped headlights instead of full headlights.

Box junctions - can enter and wait inside only if you are turning right, otherwise have to wait outside the box

When roads have multiple lanes along the same direction, you drive on the left lane and use the right lane only for overtaking (unless road markings or other stuff control traffic through lanes in a different way)

When entering a motorway, you accelerate along the hard shoulder until you match the motorway speed, then join into the left lane.

Weight limit of trailer is 3.5 tons with just driving licence and no further tests.

--------------------------------------------------------
*Motorway road studs*

Motorway road studs (lights on road):
Amber - Marks right hand edge of carriageway
White - Separates lanes in the carriageway
Red - Marks left hand edge (between leftmost lane and hard shoulder)
Green - Replaces red studs at the junction where you can enter / exit from motorway to a slip road.

---------------------------------------------------------
*Speed limits*

Speed limits (same whether using trailers or not):
built up areas - 30 mph

Speed limits (*-10 when towing trailers*):
single carriageways - 60 mph
dual carriageways - 70 mph
motorways - 70 mph 

----------------------------------------------------------

*CPR:*
Press rate - 120 presses per minute
Depth to press on chest when doing CPR - 5 to 6 cm

----------------------------------------------------------
*Braking:*

Leave a 2 second gap between you and car in front

If *rainy conditions* then *x2* the braking distance (x2 gap so 4 seconds)
If *icy conditions* then *x10* the braking distance (x10 gap so 20 seconds)


----------------------------------------------------------
*Legal stuff:*

*MOT (Mandatory Annual Test):*
Needed for cars over 3 years old.
For first three years since car manufactured, not MOT needed. For the fourth year onwards, MOT needed every year. Driving without MOT tested can lead to fines.

*Insurance:*

- Third-party: Covers damage to other people and their property.
- Third-party, fire, and theft: Includes third-party cover plus protection against fire damage or theft of your vehicle.
- Comprehensive: Covers everything, including damage to your own car.

Third-party insurance is the bare minimum you need in order to drive. Driving uninsured leads to fines.

*SORN (Statutory Off Road Notification):*
Used to declare that your vehicle is off the road and not being driven or parked on public roads in the UK.

A SORN remains invalid indefinitely until the vehicle is taxed, sold or scrapped.
Having a SORN allows you to not need to pay for road tax or insurance.


*V5C (Vehicle Registration Certificate):*
Also known as a logbook
Contains vehicle details: make, model, colour, engine size etc.
Contains registered keeper's details.


## Hazard perception

Only thing to do here is to practice,

You might find yourself flagging hazards earlier than the marking range. This is because the marking starts when they become something to react to. 

Because of this, you should spread 2-3 clicks over a range at a hazard, so that at least one flag is guaranteed to be in the marking range.

I personally used this method:
Click 1: when I notice the hazard
Wait 1 second
Click 2
Wait 0.5 seconds
Click 3

Again, practice and see what works for you. Don't just spam unlimited clicks or in patterns or you get marked 0.
