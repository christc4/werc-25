Talk to the guard, then look at the gate. Talk to the prisoner about everything, then enter the hospital. Look at the poster on the wall, then walk to the curtain to enter an operating theatre. Talk to the anaesthetist, then try to take the ether from the cart. Pick up the scalpel instead and stab him with it. Now pick up the ether before going to the recovery room at the back. Look at each of the patients, then push the vent on the wall and use it to go through. Pick up the watch and pliers from the desk, and look at both the watch and the records. Push the door to return to outside.

Talk to the man caught in the fence, then use the ether on him and cut him free with your pliers. Talk to the prisoner again, asking about 1945 and the watch inscription. Give him your pliers, then return to the hospital and through to the theatre. Talk to the patient here, then use your ether on him and take the jar. Go to the recovery area again and talk to the child. Return through the theatre to the front room and you will hear that the compound has been taken over. Take the wooden box from the table and use the jar of eyes with it. Go outside to talk to the prisoners, and ask for them to let you go.

Look at the wall of faces, then the mass grave. Enter the bunker and use the teletype machine. Go through the doorway on the right and use the switch on the right side. Take the vat to get a mirror from inside it. Look at the blueprints on the board, then look at the mirror. Use the jar of eyes with the golem. Talk to the golem and select the option relating to the man in the barbed wire. Now say "Time is truth", "Golem, wake up", "The truth is for me it will always be 1945", and then kiss the golem. Get the golem to follow you to the laboratory.

 Talk to Mengele, then use the mirror on him. Talk to the golem and have him follow you outside, then turn control of him over to the Lost Tribe.
