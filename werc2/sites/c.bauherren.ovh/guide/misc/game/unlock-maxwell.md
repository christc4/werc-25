## Unlocking last character Maxwell

I found out how from a 11 year old reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dontstarve/comments/1fbaqt/how_to_enable_creative_mode_including_how_to/)

Side note: Unlocking the second to last character Wes is not possible using console commands. He can only be found in adventure mode.

MINOR SPOILERS BELOW

Option 1- Adventure Mode (recommended)

Note: Maxwell is unlocked in game through adventure mode. If you haven't attempted adventure mode yet I highly recommend you attempt to unlock him through adventure mode.

You can enter adventure mode in game through Maxwell's Door

or

You can enter adventure mode using console commands

I saw this on the wiki but I couldn't get it to work myself

Option 2- Console Commands

WARNING: In order to unlock Maxwell you will have to watch the endgame sequence which will spoil adventure mode

Start a NEW game with any character and find some open room

Execute DebugSpawn("maxwellthrone") This should spawn maxwell in his throne

Execute DebugSpawn("maxwelllock") This should spawn a lock

Execute DebugSpawn("maxwellkey") This should spawn a key

In game pick up the key and insert into the lock

The ending sequence will play

The game will crash

Relaunch the game and Maxwell will be unlocked!
