Well-done muscle meat\*

The opportunity cost of eating muscle meat is organs. The opportunity cost of well-done muscle meat is medium-rare or rare meat.

The process of cooking destroys the heat-sensitive water-soluble B vitamins. All studies, vegans/vegetarians use to show meat eaters run the risk of nutrient defeciency take into account cooked-meat consumption, in which vitamins such as B12 are destroyed

Due to disgusting treatment of livestock, in commercial farming, cooking is safer as it destroys toxins that have accumulated in the meat due to medication and unhygenic living conditions.
