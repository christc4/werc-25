`Adam, father of all mankind, in paradise
knew the sweetness of the love of God ; and
so when for his sin he was driven forth from
the garden of Eden, and was widowed of the
love of God, he suffered grievously and
lamented with a mighty moan. And the whole
desert rang with his lamentations. His soul
was racked as he thought : “I have grieved
my beloved Lord.” He sorrowed less after
paradise and the beauty thereof – he
sorrowed that he was bereft of the love of
God, which insatiably, at every instant, draws
the soul to Him.`


`In the same way the soul which has known
God through the Holy Spirit but has
afterwards lost grace experiences the torment
that Adam suffered. There is an aching and a
deep regret in the soul that has grieved the
beloved Lord.`

`Adam pined on earth, and wept bitterly, and
the earth was not pleasing to him. He was
heartsick for God, and this was his cry:
“My soul wearies for the Lord, and I seek
Him in tears. How should I not seek Him ?
When I was with him my soul was glad and
at rest, and the enemy could not come nigh
me. But now the spirit of evil has gained
power over me, harassing and oppressing my
soul, so that I weary for the Lord even unto
death, and my spirit strains to God, and there
is nought on earth can make me glad. Nor can
my soul take comfort in any thing, but longs
once more to see the Lord, that her hunger
may be appeased. I cannot forget Him for a
single moment, and my soul languishes after
Him, and from the multitude of my afflictions
I lift up my voice and cry: ‘Have mercy upon
me, O God. Have mercy on Thy fallen
creature.’”`

`Thus did Adam lament, and tears streamed
down his face on to his beard, on to the
ground beneath his feet, and the whole desert
heard the sound of his moaning. The beasts
and the birds were hushed in grief ; while
Adam wept because peace and love were lost
to all men on account of his sin.`

`Adam knew great grief when he was banished
from paradise, but when he saw his son Abel
slain by Cain his brother, Adam’s grief was
even heavier. His soul was heavy, and he
lamented and thought: “Peoples and nations
will descend from me, and multiply, and
suffering will be their lot, and they will live in
enmity and seek to slay one another.”
And his sorrow stretched wide as the sea, and
only the soul that has come to know the Lord
and the magnitude of His love for us can
understand.`

`I, too, have lost grace and call with Adam :
“Be merciful unto me, O Lord! Bestow on me
the spirit of humility and love.”`
