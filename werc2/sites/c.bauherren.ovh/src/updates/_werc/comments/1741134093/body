I've made a lot of headway in werc app development, I want to take  the time to produce an information-dense and well-crafted video demoing werc and explaining its fundemental behaviour. I don't want to make a hit-and-run video on werc, I don't think there are any videos covering it on YouTube, I made a thirty second video once showing of a werc-site in my browser, and that attracated some plan9 folks in the comments section. But back to the 'hit and run' stuff, out of respect for the late Uriel and all who contriubted to it, if I am to go forwards it needs to be of the highest quality - like Russ Cox's video showcasing ACME
