# Maltron 2D Ergonomic Review

So&hellip;

<!--
I've put of making this video for quite a while - which turned out to be a good thing as i have a lot more positive things to say

If you clicked on this maybe you have crippling RSI,  but Im going to be talkingg about a lot more broader things, so maybe you should click off

the middle row would be useful if this was actually a programmable keyboard, but you have to use other software and stuff 

I do have some gripes, some are more Linux related and probably wont be applicable to you

I've got a list of talking points, regarding the maltron 2d keyboard. In no particular order but all relating back to whether or not you should buy this keyboard.

Firstly, if you're unwilling to learn a layout alternate to QWERTY, I recommend clickindg off this video. You can get buy with qwerty, most definitely - but I've experienced nothing but discomfort mith qwerty - so much so I involuntarily started typing in dvorak. If you're in the market for maltron, most likely you've got your fair share of experiences with RSI. Historically, maltron was very big on pushing the maltron layout, all their keyboards had physical hardware switches to change layout, Ive never used the maltron layoutt only dvorax. Buy this keyboard and continue to use qwerty, thats a disservice to yourself.

Let's talk about money, this was no small sum of change, If you want to buy this new its three hundred and thirty five pound on maltrons website. I did not buy this new. I bought this secondhand on eBay for one hundred pound including shipping. It was originally listed at one fifty, then marked down to one twenty, then either the seller sweet talked me or i sweet talked the seller and we shook on one hundred, which im happy with. I've heard some horror or happy stories of people getting fully functioning Maltrons for dirt cheap, one particular instance  that comes to mind is when Chryosan got his for one pound , the three d version. OH by the way the person I bought this from told me when he originally rented this from Maltron, they did a one month trial for something around fifty pound , which could be deducthed from the fgull cost, if you chose to buy, at the time the three d version was completely out of stock so he chose to settle with the two d version, 

<F7>+<F11>
his was not originally sold in this layout, because I use dvorak, specifically programmers dvorak and I wasnt able to touch type in the beginning, I wanted to swap the keycaps, and youd be right in thinking oh thats a very pain and stress free task, NOT SO

You see only on the left hand side almost all the keycaps when I pulled them with thingie the entire switch came out, and ive included some photos in the end of my talk, of what it looxed lixee and mind you the wires are soldered on to the end of the switches and they're hair thin. So you can imagine, how horrified I was when it came to this very simple task, And midway through many times the keyboard would just stop workinf, which immediathely came back to life when i plugged back in the usb. But the average user shouldnt have  to ever deal with that. I know maltron sell blank keycaps and many users change out their keycaps so Id expect maltron to make this a foolproof taske However when you look at the closing photos you can see see that the casing itself wherever there is an opening it looks like it was hand filed and in a very rushed way, if the left hand switch openings were more smug id not expect that to happen - but remember I bought this used, secondhand and Ive never tried a new direct from maltron two d keyboard. Plastic wise , Ive seen a lot of older maltrons get flack for their razer than plastic outer shells, I dont think thisi two ds plastic is tacky or cheap, it feels solid and its practical,

Lets talk about the wrist wrest I was initially highly skeptical of the plastic wrist wrest i was using bath towels before and thought there was no way plastic in any way shape or form could be comparable, its comfortable maltrons done a fantastic job. the height alone heres some comparisons sardines can cellotape , but it was and continues to be highly comfortable. Maltron was an ergornomics pionerer back in the day and spurred so omuch innovation so no doubtw a lot of thought has gone into ite The thumb cluster is perfect, I have asian sized hands which arent particulary big and ive experienced no discomfort reachdinf for anything . Once youre fairly confident and get in the rhthym of it this  is a joy to work @withntwlrgtrtncgtngtrgtghtneyeoyeeoep@@#####wnlswwsnwnswnswsnwnswrltlrtrltrltrlntrnlwnswnswnswtcrhgnls

Time wise, if you already know how to touch type on your standard flat keyboard, youre in a slightly better position than someone who doest know how to, but dont expect a seamless transition , its taking me a few days to get properly accustomed , i can now touchtype in dvorak and its been five days since i bought  this 
Let's talk about these spaceship lights,

If I could add anything to thhis keyboard it would be probably be a thinkpad style trackpoint preferably around the thumb clunter .

oh and flips this around its made in england, and thats one of the major reasons i bought this - 

TALK ABOUT THOE THUMB CLUSTRE MORE
Also I really really want to rest my elbow on this but IM worried iin the long run itll dawmage or put too much stress on its structural integrity
