# A talkthrough of my window manager

As a point of reference, I've got a list of talking points, with the corresponding timestamps in the pinned comment and description.

## Why I chose Sowm

I'd been using *exclusively* tiling window managers for five years. From good-old i3, bspwn, dwm, dwl and probably countless others I can't recall from the top of my head. To make a long story short, at the tailend of my tiling _career_ I ended up, without even thinking about it, putting all my windows in floating mode.

And this definitely warrants its own video, but I became very disillusioned with the concept of tiling window managers, frankly I think they're a meme and pseudo-efficent. But again, thats a topic for another day.
 
So I packed my bags and began looking in a new direction. I was already aware of SOWMs existence, its creator, Dylan, also wrote many famous nix tools, one that comes to mind, is the venerable neofetch. It was lean, mean, written in C and under lines of code.

And this goes without saying, I'm not going to use something like ga-NOME or KDE, I began my Linux journey with XFCE
