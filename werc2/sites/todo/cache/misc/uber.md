# Uber driver took advantage of my friend when she was drunk

My friend took a taxi from Soho to Limehouse after a night out. The taxi driver seeing she was drunk and asleep in the back, decided to take a detour around the M25!!

She has reached out to Uber and they’ve defended this driver stating there were roadworks so he had to take a detour. I’ve never heard of a detour requiring you to drive around the M25 to get from central London to zone 2.

I’m worried there are drivers out there willing to take advantage of vulnerable females. It makes me feel disgusted that uber would continue working with someone like this.

How can I get them to take this more seriously?
