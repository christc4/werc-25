From time-to-time &apos;important&apos; news headlines appear in my phone notifications.

Today's headline was some controversy the headmistress

> &ast; Is the term &apos;headmistress&apos; even regularly used? Now I'm wondering what people across the pond call the female head of their schools.

of Britain's &apos;strictest&apos; school was embroiled in.

Her name is Katharine Birbalsingh. Actually, over the years I've seen videos and mentions of her, in regards to the teaching style she enforces.

If you grew up watching the kids serial _Horrid Henry_ you'll be all too familiar with Miss Battleaxe, she was like a moody old witch.

I don't know anything personal about Birbalsingh, and even if I did - it's not Christ-like to gossip. 

However &ndash; I don't like when people's shtick or reputation is based of something like this, it feel's gimmicky. The fact you have the title &apos;Britain's strictest&apos; teacher, is alarming to me. Because of the lack of context, one will immediately, based of their childhood experience with strict teachers, presuppose that Birbalsingh is horrible to be around or unapproachable.

Since, this is my first diary entry in donkeys-years, I don't expect my train of thought to be organised and collected. In the future, I'd like to frame what I want to say in a constructive manner, making it easy for any reader or my future self to follow.
