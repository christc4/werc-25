Beauty occupies a narrow band but ugliness has infinite variety. Why do you want to move to London, Paris or Milan? For the culture? For the architecture? Pray tell, what is the culture of London, can you create a &apos;mind map&apos; of it, what does it embody? And if you can, who does it represent the fringes of society or the majority? The architecture, oh yes &ndash; you can gawk at the beautiful Georgian houses and shops but is this architectural ethos being followed? What buildings opposite the same streets as these historical wonders? Nothing but great big greenhouses and concrete monstrosities. Don't move to London or any city &ndash; No glitz, no glammer &ndash; It's all run by shadowy people pulling the strings.

I never noticed this as a child &ndash; no one seems to care about actual technology these days, when it comes to cryptocurrencies. There are a few bitcoin boomers I've heard on and of talk about &apos;governments&apos; and bitcoins supposed &apos;security&apos;&hellip; Go on Twitter and look at the latest crypto-tweets, is anyone actually invested in the practical uses of crypto-currency or are they in it for a quick buck? All these cryptocurrencies, Ethereum, Luna, Safemoon&ndash; can anyone tell me why I should care about these?? Can I transact securely with them, will my address be broadcast publically, is it inflation-proof?
