I think I heard this on a Luke Smith stream.

City-dweller's don't love their ""home"" they love their house because it is close to their work. They have no connection to the land.

I like this.

If you have a historical connection to the land, you run your fingers through lush glades of grass, then you may love the land. Because if the land fails, your livelihood and home for your children will too.

But with a city, no matter how many casinos and bookmakers open up in your town square, you will still see the newly built flats and people rushing to live there all because of its proximity to their place of work.

City folk don't love their house either, they love the tapestries they put up on the wall, the carpet, the art-deco and bouginess of their living room.
