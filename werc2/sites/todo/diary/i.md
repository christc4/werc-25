# Diary

When I attended Raine's Foundation secondary school, from the years 2016-2020 (now closed), I kept a digitial diary, on the computers in our form room. I don't know when I started this, it had hundreds of entries. 

When I was told of the impending shutdown, I momentarily thought of backing up my entries from the school's computer,without looking back I decided not to.

In retrospect, they were of no importance maybe if I read them now I'd have some extreme insight in my formative yearsbut spending too much time thinking about them will maybe make me sad.

If I have future children, maybe they can come here and read my thoughts and musings.

Don't expect anything important here.
