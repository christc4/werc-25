No cherub in sight
what a sight
death of a star
wait on me hand and foot, you are a stones throw away, earshot,
armsreach
i will give you a pound of my flesh
heretofore 
so wont youo stay
like shylock
for my nameesake
detract  from my message
It's like playing whack a mole with a Hydra.

ill keep a squadron within reach
conduct them like a choir
so until this bankquet ends
you may stay seteeed

bee the hero who lances our collective boil
strum from the last musician
turn oveer the misc
another prostitutee bespoke
chrun out more for you monsiuer

I await a day when words drop from the sky,

Like guinea fowl, with nowhere to hide,

When no mortal can press glass to cheek,

Hearing words of familiar speak,

I await a day when words drop from the sky,

When two deaf ears beg for a chide,

And two guilty hands beg to be tried

My Lord can pull out all the stops,

If a show needs saving,

# why

There is nothing i detest more than enforcing a man-made national curiculum dictating what poems students  must study and the quality of one's disection affects their passing grade

There is fan-fiction and then there is erecting man-made examinations for your fan-fiction

I never thought I would write poetry

Poetry isn't meant to be laid on the operating table and disected,

But it is a nice way of coping 

My favourite poem currently is [I'll never love Thee more](https://daypoems.net/poems/327.html), I wish one day I can write like that
