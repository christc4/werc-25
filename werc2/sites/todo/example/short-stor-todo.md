Short story, maybe i have attention problem, cant focus so write
There is little twighlight.
Each day has twelve hours of sunlight.
There are no seasons.
Hot and wet all year round.

Can the markets wait that long.

I knew from the moment..

The alley took a fleshed out turn and upon my arrival into the inner market a trumpet had blown, perhaps a duke but lo and behold riddled and strewed upon
that friction itself didn'tw ant to hold
a pearl falls down, with street urchins chasing after it
