# A lonely business

DRAFT

The happiness in this world has been paid by different prices

Ryu Mikoto, is a 63 year old businessman.

Yesterday the workers swallowed his explanation as to why they were longer needed. Why they'd be receiving no redundancy package. Why they'd be ...

Ryu know with no safety net to fallback on or crutch to lean on, most of those men would find their way to the bottle, with all hell breaking loose back home

The slow patter and dragging of their soles were funeral-music and nowhere else in the city could he hear such footsteps.

During his stint at upper-management, Ryu would weed out dozens of what he deemed paper-pushers

For Ryu, there was an art to the perfect firing. Just like how there is beauty in tragedy. Yesterday, Ryu toured a run-down motel, doors swung half-open revealing empty cavities where there'd been families.

# Enemy on deck DRAFT

Even in the fog of war a tank is visible

Before my cutlas could complete its arc, cannonfire volleyed across stormy seas.

We all heaved a bit, like little storm tossed boats.

These hour-long efforts to keep the musclebound captain at bay were fraught with such distractions.

My shaken focus, opened one too many angles for my foe and my exhaust struck face appeared on the edge of his sword.

At this rate, I'd be skewered any second now. 

His sword would rend my flesh from bone. And my head would be cast from my miserable torso and into the cold wet sea. It began to dawn on me, that isn't too bad with our current situation.

I shall tell you how I found myself in such a predicament.

We were told to stay put in pirate infested seas, like sitting ducks. At half-cast, the enemy would make an abrupt and loud ambush and my job was to ambush their captain, who would be first to enter the captain deck to seize whatever captured his eye. How I specifically wound up fit for this will never be a mystery to me. Years of showboating at naval tournaments had come back to bite me, capturing the judges eye I did indeed - and now I was captured exactly in my foe's line of sight. I am really - head and shoulders above my peers - and such a detachment is looking likely.

Also - despite being outnumbered 5 men to 1 - whatever bloodloss we experienced tonight, would have the scales tipped if we had the enemy captains head.

 this dispatchal job was nigh on impossible...

Swing! Slash!

My head being lobbed of was not part of today's plan and with our bout drawing on for this long, it became less about turning out the heroic victor and more about escaping to see another day. 

Our attacks had debarked a large portion of the walls and dust from above was seeping through in healthy doses. 

Legend goes he felled a man with one single punch. His beard was wispy and with each swing I lost ground, and that same sword that rended flesh from bone was inching closer and closer to me  

Was I to suffer the same grizzyl fate. Would it be commendable, to spend a few more seconds with the brute to savy my crewmen from his wrath.

Essentially, what we are doing with our program of strategic sabotage is hastening along somewhat the natural decay of America. We are chipping away at the termite-eaten timbers of the economy, so that the whole structure will collapse a few years sooner-and more catastrophically-than without our efforts. It is depressing to realize what a relatively small influence a

> She caught my eye so much so - I couldn't see anything else

I start writing something down but the entire bus jolts so what became a blissfull train of thoughts is now one long scraggly line. And I disembarked it never struck me how without the meticulously pruned parade of plants, Stratford would be just another blot of grey

Looking down the barrel of a free period was always the better option to whatever classes I had lined up. Vigorously wash my face, any pat dry. 

Swept up in such peaceful moments it's easy to lose track of whatever you're doing 

But nothing could have braced myself for who I would see momentarily shortly.

Describe doing some computer work. But she - she looked like she had fallen through a Victorian time-machine, play the perfect role of a doting wife

And as she told me about it as someone whos never researched this topic this debate was like drinking from a hose
burn the sight onto your eyelid
genuine unadultered

Surely the law of averages meant that I'd have a shot 

A misplaced jewel and I welded to my seat,, thumping up and down like a jackhammer

I would never see her again.
