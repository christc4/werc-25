<h3><b>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</b></h3>

<p class="scenedesc">
Enter <span class="charname">Roderigo</span> and <span
class="charname">Iago</span>.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Tush, never tell me, I take it much unkindly<br/>
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse,<br/>
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
’Sblood, but you will not hear me.<br/>
If ever I did dream of such a matter,<br/>
Abhor me.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Thou told’st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,<br/>
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,<br/>
Off-capp’d to him; and by the faith of man,<br/>
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.<br/>
But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,<br/>
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance,<br/>
Horribly stuff’d with epithets of war:<br/>
And in conclusion,<br/>
Nonsuits my mediators: for “Certes,” says he,<br/>
“I have already chose my officer.”<br/>
And what was he?<br/>
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,<br/>
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,<br/>
A fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife,<br/>
That never set a squadron in the field,<br/>
Nor the division of a battle knows<br/>
More than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric,<br/>
Wherein the toged consuls can propose<br/>
As masterly as he: mere prattle without practice<br/>
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election,<br/>
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<br/>
At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,<br/>
Christian and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d<br/>
By debitor and creditor, this counter-caster,<br/>
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,<br/>
And I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Why, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service,<br/>
Preferment goes by letter and affection,<br/>
And not by old gradation, where each second<br/>
Stood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself<br/>
Whether I in any just term am affin’d<br/>
To love the Moor.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
I would not follow him, then.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
O, sir, content you.<br/>
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:<br/>
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<br/>
Cannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark<br/>
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave<br/>
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,<br/>
Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,<br/>
For nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d.<br/>
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are<br/>
Who, trimm’d in forms, and visages of duty,<br/>
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,<br/>
And throwing but shows of service on their lords,<br/>
Do well thrive by them, and when they have lin’d their coats,<br/>
Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,<br/>
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,<br/>
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,<br/>
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:<br/>
In following him, I follow but myself.<br/>
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,<br/>
But seeming so for my peculiar end.<br/>
For when my outward action doth demonstrate<br/>
The native act and figure of my heart<br/>
In complement extern, ’tis not long after<br/>
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve<br/>
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,<br/>
If he can carry’t thus!
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Call up her father,<br/>
Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,<br/>
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,<br/>
And though he in a fertile climate dwell,<br/>
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,<br/>
Yet throw such changes of vexation on’t,<br/>
As it may lose some color.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Here is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell<br/>
As when, by night and negligence, the fire<br/>
Is spied in populous cities.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
What ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Awake! what ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!<br/>
Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!<br/>
Thieves, thieves!
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">
<span class="charname">Brabantio</span> appears above at a window.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
What is the reason of this terrible summons?<br/>
What is the matter there?
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Signior, is all your family within?
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Are your doors locked?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
Why, wherefore ask you this?
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Zounds, sir, you’re robb’d, for shame put on your gown,<br/>
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;<br/>
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram<br/>
Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise,<br/>
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,<br/>
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:<br/>
Arise, I say.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
What, have you lost your wits?
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
Not I. What are you?
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
My name is Roderigo.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
The worser welcome.<br/>
I have charg’d thee not to haunt about my doors;<br/>
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say<br/>
My daughter is not for thee; and now in madness,<br/>
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,<br/>
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come<br/>
To start my quiet.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Sir, sir, sir,—
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
But thou must needs be sure<br/>
My spirit and my place have in them power<br/>
To make this bitter to thee.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Patience, good sir.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
What tell’st thou me of robbing?<br/>
This is Venice. My house is not a grange.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Most grave Brabantio,<br/>
In simple and pure soul I come to you.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you.
Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have
your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse; you’ll have your nephews neigh to
you; you’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
What profane wretch art thou?
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making
the beast with two backs.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
Thou art a villain.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
You are a senator.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
This thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,<br/>
If ’t be your pleasure, and most wise consent,<br/>
(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,<br/>
At this odd-even and dull watch o’ the night,<br/>
Transported with no worse nor better guard,<br/>
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,<br/>
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:<br/>
If this be known to you, and your allowance,<br/>
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.<br/>
But if you know not this, my manners tell me,<br/>
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe<br/>
That from the sense of all civility,<br/>
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.<br/>
Your daughter (if you have not given her leave)<br/>
I say again, hath made a gross revolt,<br/>
Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes<br/>
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger<br/>
Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:<br/>
If she be in her chamber or your house,<br/>
Let loose on me the justice of the state<br/>
For thus deluding you.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
Strike on the tinder, ho!<br/>
Give me a taper! Call up all my people!<br/>
This accident is not unlike my dream,<br/>
Belief of it oppresses me already.<br/>
Light, I say, light!
</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exit from above.</i>]
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Farewell; for I must leave you:<br/>
It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place<br/>
To be produc’d, as if I stay I shall,<br/>
Against the Moor. For I do know the state,<br/>
However this may gall him with some check,<br/>
Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark’d<br/>
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,<br/>
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,<br/>
Another of his fathom they have none<br/>
To lead their business. In which regard,<br/>
Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,<br/>
Yet, for necessity of present life,<br/>
I must show out a flag and sign of love,<br/>
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,<br/>
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,<br/>
And there will I be with him. So, farewell.

</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
It is too true an evil. Gone she is,<br/>
And what’s to come of my despised time,<br/>
Is naught but bitterness. Now Roderigo,<br/>
Where didst thou see her? (O unhappy girl!)<br/>
With the Moor, say’st thou? (Who would be a father!)<br/>
How didst thou know ’twas she? (O, she deceives me<br/>
Past thought.) What said she to you? Get more tapers,<br/>
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Truly I think they are.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!<br/>
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds<br/>
By what you see them act. Is there not charms<br/>
By which the property of youth and maidhood<br/>
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,<br/>
Of some such thing?
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Yes, sir, I have indeed.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!<br/>
Some one way, some another. Do you know<br/>
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

RODERIGO.<br/>
I think I can discover him, if you please<br/>
To get good guard, and go along with me.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
Pray you lead on. At every house I’ll call,<br/>
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!<br/>
And raise some special officers of night.<br/>
On, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,<br/>
Yet do I hold it very stuff o’ the conscience<br/>
To do no contriv’d murder; I lack iniquity<br/>

IAGO.<br/>
Nay, but he prated,<br/>

Are you fast married? Be assur’d of this,<br/>

As double as the duke’s; he will divorce you,<br/>

As this that I have reach’d. For know, Iago,<br/>

O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow’d my daughter?<br/>
Damn’d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,<br/>
For I’ll refer me to all things of sense,<br/>
(If she in chains of magic were not bound)<br/>
Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,<br/>
So opposite to marriage, that she shunn’d<br/>
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,<br/>
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,<br/>
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom<br/>
Of such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight.<br/>
Judge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense,<br/>
That thou hast practis’d on her with foul charms,<br/>
Abus’d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals<br/>
That weakens motion. I’ll have’t disputed on;<br/>
’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.<br/>
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee<br/>
For an abuser of the world, a practiser<br/>
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.—<br/>

This cannot be<br/>

The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk;<br/>

That, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,<br/>
So may he with more facile question bear it,<br/>
For that it stands not in such warlike brace,<br/>
But altogether lacks the abilities<br/>
That Rhodes is dress’d in. If we make thought of this,<br/>
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful<br/>
To leave that latest which concerns him first,<br/>
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,<br/>
To wake and wage a danger profitless.

OTHELLO.<br/>
Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,<br/>
My very noble and approv’d good masters:<br/>
That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,<br/>
It is most true; true, I have married her.<br/>
The very head and front of my offending<br/>
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,<br/>
And little bless’d with the soft phrase of peace;<br/>
For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,<br/>
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us’d<br/>
Their dearest action in the tented field,<br/>
And little of this great world can I speak,<br/>
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,<br/>
And therefore little shall I grace my cause<br/>
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,<br/>
I will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver<br/>
Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,<br/>
What conjuration, and what mighty magic,<br/>
(For such proceeding I am charged withal)<br/>
I won his daughter.

<p class="drama">
BRABANTIO.<br/>
A maiden never bold:<br/>
Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion<br/>
Blush’d at herself; and she, in spite of nature,<br/>
Of years, of country, credit, everything,<br/>
To fall in love with what she fear’d to look on!<br/>
It is judgement maim’d and most imperfect<br/>
That will confess perfection so could err<br/>
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven<br/>
To find out practices of cunning hell,<br/>
Why this should be. I therefore vouch again,<br/>
That with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood,<br/>
Or with some dram conjur’d to this effect,<br/>
He wrought upon her.
</p>

<p class="drama">

OTHELLO.<br/>
Her father lov’d me, oft invited me,<br/>
Still question’d me the story of my life,<br/>
From year to year—the battles, sieges, fortunes,<br/>
That I have pass’d.<br/>
I ran it through, even from my boyish days<br/>
To the very moment that he bade me tell it,<br/>
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,<br/>
Of moving accidents by flood and field;<br/>
Of hair-breadth scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly breach;<br/>
Of being taken by the insolent foe,<br/>
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,<br/>
And portance in my traveler’s history,<br/>
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,<br/>
Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,<br/>
It was my hint to speak,—such was the process;<br/>
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,<br/>
The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads<br/>
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear<br/>
Would Desdemona seriously incline.<br/>
But still the house affairs would draw her thence,<br/>
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,<br/>
She’d come again, and with a greedy ear<br/>
Devour up my discourse; which I observing,<br/>
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means<br/>
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart<br/>
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,<br/>
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<br/>
But not intentively. I did consent,<br/>
And often did beguile her of her tears,<br/>
When I did speak of some distressful stroke<br/>
That my youth suffer’d. My story being done,<br/>
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs.<br/>
She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange;<br/>
’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.<br/>
She wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d<br/>
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank’d me,<br/>
And bade me, if I had a friend that lov’d her,<br/>
I should but teach him how to tell my story,<br/>
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:<br/>
She lov’d me for the dangers I had pass’d,<br/>
And I lov’d her that she did pity them.<br/>
This only is the witchcraft I have us’d.<br/>
Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.

To mourn a mischief that is past and gone<br/>
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.<br/>

He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears<br/>
But the free comfort which from thence he hears;<br/>
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow<br/>
That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.<br/>
These sentences to sugar or to gall,<br/>
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:<br/>
But words are words; I never yet did hear<br/>
That the bruis’d heart was pierced through the ear.<br/>
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

fortitude of the place is best known to you. And though we have there a

slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous

O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and
since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man

love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.
</p>

RODERIGO.<br/>
What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my
virtue to amend it.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Virtue! a fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are
gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles
or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of
herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or
manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in
our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise
another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
to most preposterous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging
motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you
call love, to be a sect, or scion.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
It cannot be.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man.
Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend,
and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I
could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the
wars; defeat thy favour with an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse.
It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,—put
money in thy purse,—nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou
shalt see an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse. These Moors
are changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money. The food that to him
now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the
coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with his body, she
will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must. Therefore
put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate
way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow
betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my
wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A
pox of drowning thyself! It is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be
hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.
</p>

<p class="drama">
RODERIGO.<br/>
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue?
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have told thee often, and I retell thee
again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no less
reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him: if thou canst cuckold
him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the
womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will
have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.

She that, being anger’d, her revenge being nigh,<br/>

Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence
she first loved the Moor, but for bragging, and telling her fantastical lies.
And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it.
Her eye must be fed. And what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When
the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame
it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in
years, manners, and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in: now, for want
of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself
abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor, very nature
will instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now sir, this
granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforced position) who stands so
eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble;
no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane
seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection?
Why, none, why, none! A slipper and subtle knave, a finder out of occasions;
that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage
never present itself: a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young,
and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. A
pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.

way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate
conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you from Venice.
Watch you tonight. For the command, I’ll lay’t upon you. Cassio knows you not.
I’ll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by
speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you
please, which the time shall more favourably minister.

Sir, he is rash, and very sudden in choler, and haply with his truncheon may
strike at you: provoke him that he may, for even out of that will I cause these
of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again
but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your
desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most
profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our
prosperity.

I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.

IAGO.<br/>
Not this hour, lieutenant. ’Tis not yet ten o’ th’ clock. Our general cast us
thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame: he
hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and she is sport for Jove.

<p class="drama">

What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.

Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine; and
here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
the health of black Othello.

<p class="drama">
CASSIO.<br/>
Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking. I
could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.

O, they are our friends; but one cup: I’ll drink for you.

behold, what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity, and
dare not task my weakness with any more.

I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,<br/>
When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?<br/>
And when I told thee he was of my counsel<br/>
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, “Indeed?”<br/>
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,<br/>
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain<br/>
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,<br/>
Show me thy thought.

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
My lord, you know I love you.

<p class="drama">
OTHELLO.<br/>
I think thou dost;<br/>
And for I know thou’rt full of love and honesty<br/>
And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,<br/>
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:<br/>
For such things in a false disloyal knave<br/>
Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,<br/>
They’re close dilations, working from the heart,<br/>
That passion cannot rule.

Though I am bound to every act of duty,<br/>
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.<br/>

As where’s that palace whereinto foul things<br/>

Why, why is this?<br/>
Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,<br/>

Is once to be resolv’d: exchange me for a goat<br/>

Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:<br/>
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw<br/>
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,<br/>
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,<br/>
I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;<br/>
And on the proof, there is no more but this:<br/>
Away at once with love or jealousy!

And being troubled with a raging tooth,<br/>
I could not sleep.<br/>
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,<br/>
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs.<br/>
One of this kind is Cassio:<br/>
In sleep I heard him say, “Sweet Desdemona,<br/>
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;”<br/>
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,<br/>
Cry “O sweet creature!” and then kiss me hard,<br/>
As if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots,<br/>
That grew upon my lips, then laid his leg<br/>
Over my thigh, and sigh’d and kiss’d, and then<br/>
Cried “Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!”

So help me every spirit sanctified,<br/>
As I have spoken for you all my best,<br/>

What I can do I will; and more I will<br/>
Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Is my lord angry?
</p>

<p class="drama">
EMILIA.<br/>
He went hence but now,<br/>
And certainly in strange unquietness.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,<br/>
When it hath blown his ranks into the air<br/>
And, like the devil, from his very arm<br/>
Puff’d his own brother, and can he be angry?<br/>
Something of moment then. I will go meet him.<br/>
There’s matter in’t indeed if he be angry.

Though great ones are their object. ’Tis even so.<br/>
For let our finger ache, and it indues<br/>
Our other healthful members even to that sense<br/>
Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,<br/>
Nor of them look for such observancy<br/>
As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,<br/>
I was (unhandsome warrior as I am)<br/>

</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
What,<br/>
To kiss in private?
</p>

<p class="drama">
OTHELLO.<br/>
An unauthoriz’d kiss.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Or to be naked with her friend in bed<br/>
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
</p>

<p class="drama">
OTHELLO.<br/>
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?<br/>
It is hypocrisy against the devil:<br/>
They that mean virtuously and yet do so,<br/>
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.<br/>

OTHELLO.<br/>
What then?
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Why then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,<br/>
She may, I think, bestow’t on any man.
</p>

<p class="drama">
OTHELLO.<br/>
She is protectress of her honour too.<br/>
May she give that?
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Her honour is an essence that’s not seen;<br/>
They have it very oft that have it not:<br/>
But for the handkerchief—
</p>

<p class="drama">
OTHELLO.<br/>
By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.<br/>
Thou said’st (O, it comes o’er my memory,<br/>
As doth the raven o’er the infected house,<br/>

</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Ay, what of that?

<p class="drama">
OTHELLO.<br/>
That’s not so good now.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
What<br/>
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?<br/>
Or heard him say (as knaves be such abroad,<br/>
Who having, by their own importunate suit,<br/>
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,<br/>
Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose<br/>
But they must blab.)
</p>

<p class="drama">
OTHELLO.<br/>
Hath he said anything?

He hath, my lord, but be you well assur’d,<br/>
No more than he’ll unswear.
</p>

<p class="drama">

What hath he said?
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.
</p>

<p class="drama">
OTHELLO.<br/>
What? What?
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Lie.
</p>

<p class="drama">

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
With her, on her, what you will.
</p>

<p class="drama">
OTHELLO.<br/>
Lie with her! lie on her!—We say lie on her when they belie her.—Lie with her!
that’s fulsome. Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief! To confess, and be
hanged for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to confess. I tremble at
it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some
instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
Is’t possible?—Confess?—handkerchief?—O devil!—
</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Falls in a trance.</i>]

CASSIO.<br/>
Rub him about the temples.

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
No, forbear;<br/>
The lethargy must have his quiet course.<br/>
If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by<br/>
Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs:<br/>
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,<br/>
He will recover straight. When he is gone,<br/>
I would on great occasion speak with you.

I mock you? No, by heaven.<br/>

<p class="drama">
OTHELLO.<br/>
A horned man’s a monster and a beast.

There’s many a beast, then, in a populous city,<br/>

Did he confess it?
</p>

<p class="drama">

Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.<br/>
O, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,<br/>
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,<br/>
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,<br/>
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

OTHELLO.<br/>
O, thou art wise, ’tis certain.
</p>

<p class="drama">
IAGO.<br/>
Stand you awhile apart,<br/>
Confine yourself but in a patient list.<br/>
Whilst you were here o’erwhelmed with your grief,<br/>
(A passion most unsuiting such a man)<br/>
Cassio came hither. I shifted him away,<br/>
And laid good ’scuse upon your ecstasy,<br/>
Bade him anon return, and here speak with me,<br/>
The which he promis’d. Do but encave yourself,<br/>
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,<br/>
That dwell in every region of his face;<br/>
For I will make him tell the tale anew,<br/>
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when<br/>
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:<br/>
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,<br/>
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,<br/>
And nothing of a man.

<p class="drama">

Dost thou hear, Iago?<br/>
I will be found most cunning in my patience;<br/>
But,—dost thou hear?—most bloody.
</p>

<p class="drama">

That’s not amiss.<br/>
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?

<p class="right">
[<i><span class="charname">Othello</span> withdraws.</i>]
</p>

<p class="drama">
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,<br/>
A housewife that by selling her desires<br/>
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature<br/>
That dotes on Cassio, (as ’tis the strumpet’s plague<br/>
To beguile many and be beguil’d by one.)<br/>

From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.

Do you hear, Cassio?

OTHELLO.<br/>
Now he importunes him<br/>
To tell it o’er. Go to, well said, well said.

I marry her? What? A customer? I prithee, bear some charity to my wit, do not

So, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.

Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.

I am a very villain else.

<p class="drama">
OTHELLO.<br/>
Have you scored me? Well.
</p>

CASSIO.<br/>
This is the monkey’s own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her, out of
her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.

Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story.

And she died singing it. That song tonight<br/>

I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!<br/>
Dost thou in conscience think,—tell me, Emilia,—<br/>
That there be women do abuse their husbands<br/>
In such gross kind?
</p>

<p class="drama">

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
</p>

<p class="drama">

The world’s a huge thing. It is a great price<br/>
For a small vice.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DESDEMONA.<br/>
In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
</p>

<p class="drama">
EMILIA.<br/>
In troth, I think I should, and undo’t when I had done. Marry, I would not do
such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns,
petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for the whole world—why,
who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should
venture purgatory for ’t.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DESDEMONA.<br/>
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong for the whole world.
</p>

<p class="drama">
EMILIA.<br/>
Why, the wrong is but a wrong i’ the world; and having the world for your
labour, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DESDEMONA.<br/>
I do not think there is any such woman.
</p>

<p class="drama">
EMILIA.<br/>
Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played
for.<br/>
But I do think it is their husbands’ faults<br/>
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,<br/>
And pour our treasures into foreign laps;<br/>
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,<br/>
Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,<br/>
Or scant our former having in despite.<br/>
Why, we have galls; and though we have some grace,<br/>
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know<br/>
Their wives have sense like them: they see, and smell<br/>
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,<br/>
As husbands have. What is it that they do<br/>
When they change us for others? Is it sport?<br/>
I think it is. And doth affection breed it?<br/>
I think it doth. Is’t frailty that thus errs?<br/>
It is so too. And have not we affections,<br/>
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?<br/>
Then let them use us well: else let them know,<br/>
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
</p>

No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,<br/>
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,<br/>
Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,<br/>
Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak<br/>
Of one that loved not wisely, but too well;<br/>
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,<br/>
Perplex’d in the extreme; of one whose hand,<br/>
Like the base Judean, threw a pearl away<br/>
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu’d eyes,<br/>
Albeit unused to the melting mood,<br/>
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees<br/>
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this.<br/>
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,<br/>
Where a malignant and a turban’d Turk<br/>
Beat a Venetian and traduc’d the state,<br/>
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,<br/>
And smote him, thus.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
