<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">King Richard, John of
Gaunt,</span> with other Nobles and Attendants.</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,<br/>
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,<br/>
Brought hither Henry Hereford, thy bold son,<br/>
Here to make good the boist’rous late appeal,<br/>
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,<br/>
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
</p>

<p class="drama">
GAUNT.<br/>
I have, my liege.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him<br/>
If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice,<br/>
Or worthily, as a good subject should,<br/>
On some known ground of treachery in him?
</p>

<p class="drama">
GAUNT.<br/>
As near as I could sift him on that argument,<br/>
On some apparent danger seen in him<br/>
Aimed at your Highness, no inveterate malice.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
Then call them to our presence. Face to face<br/>
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear<br/>
The accuser and the accused freely speak.<br/>
High-stomached are they both and full of ire,<br/>
In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Bolingbroke</span>
and <span class="charname">Mowbray</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
BOLINGBROKE.<br/>
Many years of happy days befall<br/>
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
</p>

<p class="drama">
MOWBRAY.<br/>
Each day still better other’s happiness<br/>
Until the heavens, envying earth’s good hap,<br/>
Add an immortal title to your crown!
</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
We thank you both. Yet one but flatters us,<br/>
As well appeareth by the cause you come,<br/>
Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.<br/>
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object<br/>
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOLINGBROKE.<br/>
First—heaven be the record to my speech!—<br/>
In the devotion of a subject’s love,<br/>
Tend’ring the precious safety of my prince,<br/>
And free from other misbegotten hate,<br/>
Come I appellant to this princely presence.<br/>
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,<br/>
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak<br/>
My body shall make good upon this earth,<br/>
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.<br/>
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,<br/>
Too good to be so and too bad to live,<br/>
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,<br/>
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.<br/>
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,<br/>
With a foul traitor’s name stuff I thy throat,<br/>
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,<br/>
What my tongue speaks, my right-drawn sword may prove.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MOWBRAY.<br/>
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.<br/>
’Tis not the trial of a woman’s war,<br/>
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,<br/>
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;<br/>
The blood is hot that must be cooled for this.<br/>
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast<br/>
As to be hushed and naught at all to say.<br/>
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me<br/>
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech,<br/>
Which else would post until it had returned<br/>
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.<br/>
Setting aside his high blood’s royalty,<br/>
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,<br/>
I do defy him, and I spit at him,<br/>
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain;<br/>
Which to maintain, I would allow him odds<br/>
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot<br/>
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,<br/>
Or any other ground inhabitable<br/>
Wherever Englishman durst set his foot.<br/>
Meantime let this defend my loyalty:<br/>
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOLINGBROKE.<br/>
Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,<br/>
Disclaiming here the kindred of the King,<br/>
And lay aside my high blood’s royalty,<br/>
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.<br/>
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength<br/>
As to take up mine honour’s pawn, then stoop.<br/>
By that and all the rites of knighthood else,<br/>
Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,<br/>
What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MOWBRAY.<br/>
I take it up; and by that sword I swear<br/>
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,<br/>
I’ll answer thee in any fair degree<br/>
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial.<br/>
And when I mount, alive may I not light<br/>
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!
</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray’s charge?<br/>
It must be great that can inherit us<br/>
So much as of a thought of ill in him.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOLINGBROKE.<br/>
Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true:<br/>
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles<br/>
In name of lendings for your highness’ soldiers,<br/>
The which he hath detained for lewd employments,<br/>
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.<br/>
Besides I say, and will in battle prove,<br/>
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge<br/>
That ever was surveyed by English eye,<br/>
That all the treasons for these eighteen years<br/>
Complotted and contrived in this land<br/>
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.<br/>
Further I say, and further will maintain<br/>
Upon his bad life to make all this good,<br/>
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death,<br/>
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,<br/>
And consequently, like a traitor coward,<br/>
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood,<br/>
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel’s, cries<br/>
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth<br/>
To me for justice and rough chastisement.<br/>
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,<br/>
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
How high a pitch his resolution soars!<br/>
Thomas of Norfolk, what sayst thou to this?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MOWBRAY.<br/>
O! let my sovereign turn away his face<br/>
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,<br/>
Till I have told this slander of his blood<br/>
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears.<br/>
Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom’s heir,<br/>
As he is but my father’s brother’s son,<br/>
Now, by my sceptre’s awe I make a vow<br/>
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood<br/>
Should nothing privilege him nor partialize<br/>
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.<br/>
He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou.<br/>
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MOWBRAY.<br/>
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,<br/>
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.<br/>
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais<br/>
Disbursed I duly to his highness’ soldiers;<br/>
The other part reserved I by consent,<br/>
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt<br/>
Upon remainder of a dear account<br/>
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen.<br/>
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester’s death,<br/>
I slew him not, but to my own disgrace<br/>
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.<br/>
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,<br/>
The honourable father to my foe,<br/>
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,<br/>
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;<br/>
But ere I last received the sacrament<br/>
I did confess it and exactly begged<br/>
Your Grace’s pardon, and I hope I had it.<br/>
This is my fault. As for the rest appealed,<br/>
It issues from the rancour of a villain,<br/>
A recreant and most degenerate traitor,<br/>
Which in myself I boldly will defend,<br/>
And interchangeably hurl down my gage<br/>
Upon this overweening traitor’s foot,<br/>
To prove myself a loyal gentleman<br/>
Even in the best blood chambered in his bosom.<br/>
In haste whereof most heartily I pray<br/>
Your highness to assign our trial day.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me.<br/>
Let’s purge this choler without letting blood.<br/>
This we prescribe, though no physician;<br/>
Deep malice makes too deep incision.<br/>
Forget, forgive, conclude and be agreed;<br/>
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.<br/>
Good uncle, let this end where it begun;<br/>
We’ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GAUNT.<br/>
To be a make-peace shall become my age.<br/>
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk’s gage.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
And, Norfolk, throw down his.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GAUNT.<br/>
When, Harry, when?<br/>
Obedience bids I should not bid again.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MOWBRAY.<br/>
Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.<br/>
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame.<br/>
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,<br/>
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,<br/>
To dark dishonour’s use thou shalt not have.<br/>
I am disgraced, impeached, and baffled here,<br/>
Pierced to the soul with slander’s venomed spear,<br/>
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood<br/>
Which breathed this poison.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
Rage must be withstood.<br/>
Give me his gage. Lions make leopards tame.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MOWBRAY.<br/>
Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame,<br/>
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,<br/>
The purest treasure mortal times afford<br/>
Is spotless reputation; that away,<br/>
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.<br/>
A jewel in a ten-times-barred-up chest<br/>
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.<br/>
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one.<br/>
Take honour from me, and my life is done.<br/>
Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;<br/>
In that I live, and for that will I die.
</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOLINGBROKE.<br/>
O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!<br/>
Shall I seem crest-fallen in my father’s sight?<br/>
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height<br/>
Before this outdared dastard? Ere my tongue<br/>
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong<br/>
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear<br/>
The slavish motive of recanting fear<br/>
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,<br/>
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray’s face.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Gaunt</span>.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br/>
We were not born to sue, but to command;<br/>
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,<br/>
Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,<br/>
At Coventry upon Saint Lambert’s day.<br/>
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate<br/>
The swelling difference of your settled hate.<br/>
Since we cannot atone you, we shall see<br/>
Justice design the victor’s chivalry.<br/>
Lord Marshal, command our officers-at-arms<br/>

the <span class="charname">Duchess of Gloucester</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
GAUNT.<br/>
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock’s blood<br/>
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims<br/>
To stir against the butchers of his life.<br/>
But since correction lieth in those hands<br/>
Which made the fault that we cannot correct,<br/>
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven,<br/>
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,<br/>
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders’ heads.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DUCHESS.<br/>
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?<br/>
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?<br/>
Edward’s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,<br/>
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,<br/>
Or seven fair branches springing from one root.<br/>
Some of those seven are dried by nature’s course,<br/>
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;<br/>
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,<br/>
One vial full of Edward’s sacred blood,<br/>
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,<br/>
Is cracked, and all the precious liquor spilt,<br/>
Is hacked down, and his summer leaves all faded,<br/>
By envy’s hand and murder’s bloody axe.<br/>
Ah, Gaunt! his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,<br/>
That metal, that self mould, that fashioned thee<br/>
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,<br/>
Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent<br/>
In some large measure to thy father’s death<br/>
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,<br/>
Who was the model of thy father’s life.<br/>
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair.<br/>
In suff’ring thus thy brother to be slaughtered,<br/>
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,<br/>
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.<br/>
That which in mean men we entitle patience<br/>
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.<br/>
What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life,<br/>
The best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GAUNT.<br/>
God’s is the quarrel; for God’s substitute,<br/>
His deputy anointed in His sight,<br/>
Hath caused his death, the which if wrongfully,<br/>
Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift<br/>
An angry arm against His minister.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DUCHESS.<br/>
Where then, alas! may I complain myself?
</p>

<p class="drama">
GAUNT.<br/>
To God, the widow’s champion and defence.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DUCHESS.<br/>
Why then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.<br/>
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold<br/>
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight.<br/>
O, sit my husband’s wrongs on Hereford’s spear,<br/>
That it may enter butcher Mowbray’s breast!<br/>
Or if misfortune miss the first career,<br/>
Be Mowbray’s sins so heavy in his bosom<br/>
That they may break his foaming courser’s back<br/>
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,<br/>
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!<br/>
Farewell, old Gaunt. Thy sometimes brother’s wife<br/>
With her companion, Grief, must end her life.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GAUNT.<br/>
Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry.<br/>
As much good stay with thee as go with me!
</p>

<p class="drama">
DUCHESS.<br/>
Yet one word more. Grief boundeth where it falls,<br/>
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight.<br/>
I take my leave before I have begun,<br/>
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.<br/>
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.<br/>
Lo, this is all. Nay, yet depart not so!<br/>
Though this be all, do not so quickly go;<br/>
I shall remember more. Bid him—ah, what?—<br/>
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.<br/>
Alack, and what shall good old York there see<br/>
But empty lodgings and unfurnished walls,<br/>
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?<br/>
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?<br/>
Therefore commend me; let him not come there<br/>
To seek out sorrow that dwells everywhere.<br/>
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die!<br/>
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

I will unfold some causes of your deaths:<br/>
You have misled a prince, a royal king,<br/>
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,<br/>
By you unhappied and disfigured clean.<br/>
You have in manner with your sinful hours<br/>
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,<br/>
Broke the possession of a royal bed,<br/>
And stained the beauty of a fair queen’s cheeks<br/>
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.<br/>
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,<br/>
Near to the King in blood, and near in love<br/>
Till you did make him misinterpret me,<br/>
Have stooped my neck under your injuries<br/>
And sighed my English breath in foreign clouds,<br/>
Eating the bitter bread of banishment,<br/>
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,<br/>
Disparked my parks and felled my forest woods,<br/>
From my own windows torn my household coat,<br/>
Rased out my imprese, leaving me no sign<br/>
Save men’s opinions and my living blood<br/>
To show the world I am a gentleman.<br/>
This and much more, much more than twice all this,<br/>
Condemns you to the death. See them delivered over<br/>
To execution and the hand of death.

Did scowl on gentle Richard. No man cried “God save him!”<br/>
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home,<br/>
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head,<br/>
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,<br/>
His face still combating with tears and smiles,<br/>
The badges of his grief and patience,<br/>
That had not God for some strong purpose, steeled<br/>
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,<br/>
And barbarism itself have pitied him.<br/>

RICHARD.<br/>
I have been studying how I may compare<br/>
This prison where I live unto the world;<br/>
And for because the world is populous<br/>
And here is not a creature but myself,<br/>
I cannot do it. Yet I’ll hammer it out.<br/>
My brain I’ll prove the female to my soul,<br/>
My soul the father, and these two beget<br/>
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,<br/>
And these same thoughts people this little world,<br/>
In humours like the people of this world,<br/>
For no thought is contented. The better sort,<br/>
As thoughts of things divine, are intermixed<br/>
With scruples, and do set the word itself<br/>
Against the word, as thus: “Come, little ones”;<br/>
And then again:<br/>
“It is as hard to come as for a camel<br/>
To thread the postern of a needle’s eye.”<br/>
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot<br/>
Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails<br/>
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs<br/>
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,<br/>
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.<br/>
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves<br/>
That they are not the first of fortune’s slaves,<br/>
Nor shall not be the last, like silly beggars<br/>
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame<br/>
That many have and others must sit there;<br/>
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,<br/>
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back<br/>
Of such as have before endured the like.<br/>
Thus play I in one person many people,<br/>
And none contented. Sometimes am I king;<br/>
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,<br/>
And so I am. Then crushing penury<br/>
Persuades me I was better when a king;<br/>
Then am I kinged again, and by and by<br/>
Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke,<br/>
And straight am nothing. But whate’er I be,<br/>

To check time broke in a disordered string;<br/>
But for the concord of my state and time<br/>
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.<br/>
I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;<br/>
For now hath time made me his numb’ring clock.<br/>
My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar<br/>
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,<br/>
Whereto my finger, like a dial’s point,<br/>
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.<br/>
Now, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is<br/>
Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,<br/>
Which is the bell. So sighs and tears and groans<br/>
Show minutes, times, and hours. But my time<br/>
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke’s proud joy,<br/>
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o’ the clock.<br/>
This music mads me! Let it sound no more;<br/>
For though it have holp madmen to their wits,<br/>
In me it seems it will make wise men mad.<br/>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
