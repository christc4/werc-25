# Why not HTTPS?

*Last update: 2024/09/09*

Did you get a browser warning but proceeded to enter anyway?

Or maybe $BROWSER, wouldn't even load my page and *auto* redirected to HTTPS... 

<hr>

First and foremost, there is absolutely *nothing* on my site that needs encryption. Yes certs are free, and my site used to have a beautiful padlock for 

	*https*://avsbq.org

But, people will not click on your site!

I originally owned the domain

	https://christamlai.xyz

Which redirected to my github.io site, many people out of principle wouldn't click on it for muh virus reasons..


I didn't renew that domain and stuck to a github.io site for a while and because it wasn't a pretty '.com' people were scared and wouldn't click on it

Then.. I got a '.org' and my site had a 'dark' theme and a 'hacker' font, and would you guess it.. No one would click on it
