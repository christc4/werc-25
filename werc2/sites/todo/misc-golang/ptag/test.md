This is often traced to PIE root 
 "to say, speak," but Boutkan, on the grounds of formal objection to proposed cognates (Sanskrit 
 "speaks," Old Welsh 
 "say," Latin 
 "not allow"), has it as of "no (certain) IE etymology," and writes, "This is complicated."

Old English 
 "to allow to remain in the same state or condition; to let remain, allow to survive; to have left (of a deceased person, in reference to heirs, etc.); to 
 (a heritage)," from Proto-Germanic 
 (source also of Old Frisian 
 "to leave," Old Saxon 
 "left over"), causative of 
 "remain" (source of Old English 
, German 
, Gothic 
 "to remain"), from PIE root 
 "to stick, adhere."
The Germanic root seems to have had only the sense "remain, continue" (which was in Old English as well but has since become obsolete), which also is in Greek 
 "persevering, importunate." But this usually is regarded as a development from the primary PIE sense of "adhere, be sticky" (compare Lithuanian 
, Old Church Slavonic 
 "to adhere," Greek 
 "grease," Sanskrit 
 "to smear, adhere to."
Originally a strong verb (past participle 
), it early switched to a weak form. Meaning "go away, take one's departure, depart from; leave behind" (c. 1200) comes from notion of "leave behind" (as in 
 "to die;" 
 "retreat"). From c. 1200 as "to stop, cease; give up, relinquish, abstain from having to do with; discontinue, come to an end;" also "to omit, neglect; to abandon, forsake, desert; divorce;" also "allow (someone) to go."
Colloquial use for "let, allow" is by 1840, said by OED to be chiefly American English. Not related to 
 (n.). To 
 "omit" is from late 15c. To 
 is from c. 1400; to 
 is from 1825. To 
 is from 1780. To 
 is from 1902. 
 is from c. 1400 as "cease, desist" (transitive); early 15c. as "stop, make an end" (intransitive).
Old English 
 (Northumbrian 
) "to allow; to leave behind, depart from; leave undone; 
," also "to rent, put to rent or hire" (class VII strong verb; past tense 
, 
, past participle 
), from Proto-Germanic 
 (source also of Old Saxon 
, Old Frisian 
, Dutch 
, Old High German 
, German 
, Gothic 
 "to leave, let"), from PIE 
, extended form of root 
 "to let go, slacken." If that derivation is correct, the etymological sense might be "let go through weariness, neglect."
He points to similar developments in French 
 "to let" from Latin 
 "to slacken," German 
 "to permit, to let," from dialectal 
 "loose."
"The shortening of the root vowel ... has not been satisfactorily explained" [OED]. Of blood, from late Old English. Other Old and Middle English senses include "regard as, consider; behave toward; allow to escape; pretend;" to

To 
 "allow to go unpunished, excuse from service" is from 1814. To 
 is from 1725 as "allow (something) to be known, betray one's knowledge of," 1822 as "pretend" (OED finds a similar use in the phrase 
 in a letter from 1637). To 
 is late 12c. as "allow to depart" (transitive); intransitive use "be concluded," of schools, meetings, etc., is from 1888, considered by Century Dictionary (1895) to be "Rural, U.S." Of garments, etc., late 14c.

 "leave it alone" is from c. 1300; 
 "let it pass, leave it alone" is from early 14c. To 
 is from c. 1300 as "allow to escape," 1520s as "cease to restrain," 1530s as "dismiss from one's thoughts." 
 "let it pass, no matter" is as old as Chaucer's Wife of Bath: "But age allas Hath me biraft my beautee Lat it go, far wel, the deuel go ther with!" [c. 1395]. 
 "show me" is from c. 1300.
