It was love at first sight, I originally got it from eBay for a steal straight from Japan - and packaged rather nicely and cutesy.

The first pen was originally from Japan, later the price skyrocketed.

However the Amazon version was horribly scratchy. Maybe quality control 

I no longer write as much and I gave those two pens away.
