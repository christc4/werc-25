# Can nature err unto itself

People are 'happy' to justify failed first relationships because you learn something, actually most people learn the wrong things, such as redpill

Ying and I.

Inconsequential, basically cutting lifeline miss shibli, yees in nature

Munzir, gay misheard, or you like ying, own it, and say yes she is the love of my life I want to have babies with her, thats what a 'girlfriend' literally is,

She was hyper intelligent and that meant, she was in tune with her body and hormones

thee only good thing is that now my world view is so different so so different
