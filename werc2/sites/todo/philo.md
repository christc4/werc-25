## Art

The 'you must be this tall to ride' equivalent in the 'art-world' is whether or not you can draw a face, free-style or through precision tools, it doesn't matter. If I see you have mutilated a face, your opinion becomes null and void to me.

> "The eyes! The window to the soul! The face! The terminus between people!"

## On friends

[Dunbar's number](http://95.179.238.202/archive/think/dunbar_number) holds that we can only maintain 150 relationships.

The two lowest common denominators that act as friendships' glue is

> utility + satisfaction

### Burn a bridge or drain a swamp?

Can you salvage a friendship built on locker-room talk? Maybe, but it'll be the shortest-burning candle to ever candle.

## Software

When you can no longer see the forest for the trees. When the artisans, hobbyists and tinkerers move out and the industrialists, contracters, men in suits step in, I generally step out

### Minimalism

If you are principled on what you believe. I respect you. If you are not and tout the latest slogan, you are 'faux' and to be ousted

Lot's of people maybe for tongue and cheek throw out 'ed is the original unix editor' and others spend their time bickering on 'vim Vs emacs'.

I care about operation count, first and foremost.

How many operations does it take to do this, then I compare which is more performant

#### Minimalism, a time vampire?

I weigh with the finest scale each addition to my code, 

### Wingnuts

True wingnuts who remain principled to the core, who wouldn't give CPR to their own father for fear of being called gay, they I can somewhat respect


I have even encountered freedom zealots who haven't the faintest clue what the IME is.. But will happily lecture me on why

### Web

Am I a mutilating surgeon of HTML?

Why so 'barebones'? Is my life just bleak. Why not snazz things up a bit?
