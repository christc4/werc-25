# 2024/

So... you made it back. Well, welcome to the new and might I say improved version of Christ Talk Show titled, From the Iron Sights...

Editing... It's taxing... but personal laziness aside I'm not interested in hit and run high-production videos. Like I could slap on a really inflammatory title on the... _Cult of ThinkPads_ 

<img src="http://avsbq.org/blog/.pix/vhspad.avif">

or the _Myth of Tiling_ and yeah I guess if the _Algorithm God's_ pick it up I'd get more viewership and maybe some shekels my way, but you know this is more natural..

Okay... list of topics

- Classic ThinkPad's just a meme?
- How to draw? Art talk

## Viewer questions

_Redacted_ asks about countries and their border's

I am going to respond with the history of borders, were they usually manned in Europe, what happened to refugees in England, French Protestants

## ThinkPad's

I've been meaning to do a fuller video on this, as it was quite dear to my heart, but the dearer something is the more natural your speech should be... So I'll say it in my talk show

In your heart of hearts, you'll already know if you're a tinkerer. If you're not then maybe you're more of a pragmatist. If not that maybe you're flat-out broke and the internet's helped you come to the conclusion that ThinkPad's are the solution. Or maybe you're a bit of everything...

### Impractical aspects

Fan noise

## Blogging problems

### Naming convention

Ideally everyone would be familiar with your naming convention, right?

Let's take for example my subdomains...

Src, 

msc, became misc and so on

bio, biography,

ppl, people

## How to draw

## A reintroduction on why we draw

Why? Well we're trying to capture a reality, and that reality can be suspended in a fixed point in space-time, our canvases

Talk about the cat drawing Wan drew and how you afiled in favourites

talk about web ugliness demonstaret your red and bluee and html list bullet point ugliness
