2024/09/24: _redacted_ is meeting me at my home to discuss: websites, computing, life amongst other things


- Preamble, cookie cutter approach, condesending patronising way, subway surfers
google of course wont index these html forgotten tips, its really the oldheads that know this
ed text editor, vim, emacs can never conceive it, because it was teletype printes but you can still transfer principles

- why does doctype exist?
	- different html standards
	- w3c

- elephant in the room
	- is my site the ugliest?
		- [site history](archive/misc/personal/computing/site_history)

- looking at other people's sites
	- [lukesmith](https://lukesmith.xyz/)
		- html entities
			- apostrophe?
			- utf-8, ndash (vim?), whitespace before tags
			- ndash 7 bytes, dash 1 byte
	
- what have i done to minimise?
	- 'minified' html
		- most static/dynamic sites minify *after*, i do not
			- 'echo -n', 'awk, printf'
	- href
		- '//' instead of 'http://'	
	- no ""
	- forgoing 'pre' and 'code'
		- object?
	- Combined selectors for nav li li>ul,nav li>ul into nav li ul since both refer to <ul> inside a <li>.
	- flex basis to flex 1
	- list style type to...
	- margin left right, and so on

- is minification a fruitless endeavour?
	- will images offset any potential gains?
		- compare the favicon of [mo](https://mohdsaed.com) and [luke](https://lukesmith.xyz)
	- [asymptote](handbook/cs/coding/wolfram/asymptote)

- power ploy, coercion
	- https
		- [danluu](https://danluu.com/web-bloat/)
		- [xahlee](http://xahlee.info/w/why_no_https.html)
		- http2 enforces encryption on all connections
		- out of date certs, browser warnings
	- domain registrar
		- tld sneering
		- nike vs namebrand
		- yellow pages
			- yes... static ips etc. 
	- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
		- fetch(), for .json in main domain

- peeved at _redacted's_ idiot question
	- jog his memory, "why do you have 1000 pages"
		- set of a chain-reaction
		- [answer](/blog/why/websites)
		- [2nd answer](/blog/offloading_parenting)

- werc
	- caching
		- /tmp/fltrcache and sitemap.txt
	- suckless, anselm
	- current problem
		- percentage sign
