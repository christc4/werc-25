# Pre -

I hate scripts - the best software tutorials are the ones freestyled because then the narrator has more or less intimate knowledge - with what he's actually saying - 

But to stop it becoming disjointed

You go to my site-

Keep in mind, this isn't a hand-holding guide - as in - you won't be able to pause and follow along with me as we put together a website and server from scratch - this is more or less - an explanation of how I do my website.

If you do want a 'good' guide - check the pinned comment - regarding 'nginx, debian and certbot'A

If you don't know what any of those words mean - this video is for you.

Don't use wix, cardd, github.io, squarespace, medium, blogger, substack, linkedin.

Look... there are more how to set up a website vids than there are stars in the known universe - so why contribute by making another

Frankly - a lot of them absolutely suck - and aren't worth wasting my breath on.

We'll start with the basicmost explanations, then technical things and for the afterhours - you can hear my views on why you should be a 'webmaster' not a ''webslave'.

## Show my site

But first - let's pick apart [my site](https://avsbq.org)

You might say it's ugly - which is fine. Unlike in real life, we can change our web appearances - with a pinch of .css (which is how you style a website) everything can be 'revamped' 'redisigned'

So there's that.

My site has a map, a [sitemap](https://avsbq.org/sitemap)
If your browser already caches my site, it'll load in a jiffy if not - depending on your file count it'll take a few seconds.

Look at the sidebar, elipses for too long and the sitemap


Go to pink window and open a shtml talk about shtml

How to choose a server
- storage
- OS
- location... where will most your traffic be?	

How to choose a vultr webserver
I chose openbsd

this sites IP is 95.179.238.202

Why use url's if we can just use ones IP address?

- can't use https
- subdomains
- hard to remember...

What about www, if someone types http avsbq.org or www.avsbq.org but if someone does http://www.avsbq.org then it does take you to the insecure site


## What is a domain registrar

### epik

- hacked
- victim of crime

## What is rcctl

## What is httpd

- openBSD's own built-in webserver
- supports TLS 
- lack of gzip compression - larger than necessary packets sent out
- explain gzip briefly
- performance penalty
- BUT security oriented

You can read up on how openBSD in general handles security as opposed to GNU/Linux

What are ports

Show my conf

## What is TLS/SSL

## What is acme-client

Show my .conf

## werc

- hidden sites?
- hide from sidebar
- 'dotfiles' and 'underscore'
- [secret page](https://avsbq.org/.me)




Depending on how your markdown is processed and treated you need to use html entities, as asterisk and underscore will bolden or italicize text.
