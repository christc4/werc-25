If you already know a fair bit about ergonomics and functionality in peripherals - skip this beginning portion.

Absolute idiots - say to me - why fuss over minutae

You have to understand

Once a design gets finalised at the drawing board and goes into mass production and consumer habits and preferences are ingrained - bad desigin gets a foothold of the market share and people don't want change
And anyone who wants to chime in with a radical change - that'd not only boost productivity or egronomics - they're bound to get shut down why?

Now look - the average person - who doesn't know any better - I don't want to shut them down - but i t's the particular subset of people who add more action needed to complete a basic task - are what is wrong with the world

Like for example - copy and pasting - excluding text editors where its only one keypress
requires a modifier key to be depressed, and look at your keyboard theres a good few keys im sure youve never pressed - why dont hardware manufacters create a dedicated key to do just that - copy paste, zoom, back a tab, forward a tab - well there have been

That's out the way

There's only so much you can say about trackballs - so I'll keep it short
