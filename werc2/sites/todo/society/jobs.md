phantomatic jobs

&ldquo;The definition of Germany: the customer inserts a (returnable) bottle into the deposit machine. The machine doesn't accept it because its wrinkled. The customer straightens the bottle and pushes it in again. The machine accepts it-and crushes it." 

&ldquo;You are a piece precisely chiseled for the jigsaw puzzle you belong in, and not anything else&rdquo;

_Looking down the barrel of a 4:55 meeting_

> If one wanted to crush and destroy a man entirely, to mete out to him the most terrible punishment... all one would have to do would be to make him do work that was completely and utterly devoid of usefulness and meaning - Fyodor Dostoyevsky
