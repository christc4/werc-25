'Eating with Tod' is a 'foodie' or food conoeissuer

His closing catchphrase is...

"if you cant take a date,  take a mate"

# i think

I think - personal opinion - that he bears a striking resemblance to the 'eat the bugz' soyjak. However there is much debate within the scientific community over this - so more peer-reviewed evidence is needed.

# rumours

Some people malign me as having a grudge against this man - i do not - i only hope he converts those calories to muscles - as all should after eating any protein rich meal
