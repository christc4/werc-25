A more peckish or disagreeable noble would have hovelled yet another serving of today's pastry but Rudolph Faus was more or less content with today's offering. In fact, it was precisely enough to quell the seeds of rebelling sprouting in today's addendum.

One by one, disgruntled novels from every inch of the kingdom would sprawl in. Tonight, was the revealing of King Henry's heir to all nobledom of the Kingdom of Harkness.

Faus, his suit generic, and his shoes just as black and leathery as the pair next to him. If uniformity had ever been perfected as of today. Ordinarily, the fact one hails from the country may heave a series of coughs and gags but anyone could decipher from a seconds-glance that Rudolph Faus was one of the countryside most talented nobles. At age 7, he had perfected a treatment to prevent blood loss in wounded soildiers.

As Faus, idley swirded the wine, a caririage which swalloed up the other country nobels would appear. Rattled and banged in a rocking trance of half an hour, until finally absovling them in the cool early evening.

Tonight was the unveiling of the King's heir, tradition dictated that save for a few of the closest King's advisors, ordinary nobles were forbidden from seeing the future King until age 18. It wasn't actually known how many children the King had, anyone without an aptitude for magic was quietly culled to some foreign country to pursue a useles degree. Tera smiled, it was a fleeting smiled, but reserved for a purer form of get-together.

Fauss was momentarily forgotten, as the nobles swooned to embrace the King's heir. The King's campaign to mold him into the perfect specimen of man was painfully obvious.

It was probably a lucky thing that Fauss stood up when he did, a minute too late and the King would have been thrown out
Fauss seated himself apologetically at the furtherst dining set when all was dying down. Within a minutes notice, the King was dead.
