# World 

As far as written history goes back, beastkind and humans have never peacefully co-existed. Beastkind are said to be the descendants of the ancient "dog, cat, fox, sheep". They live in the fringes of society, ostracised - spoken of in hush tones and when seen in public are usually donning shackles and rags.

Old wives tales tell of a time when beastkind possessed magic on par with human magic, but human nobles wary of their rising influence culled beasts who possessed mana, until their affinity for magic was permanently purged from their bloodstream.

So humans use magic and beastkind don't.

# Prologue

Seta's parents due to financial hardships end up selling Seta as an indentured servant = basically a slave as it was either that or have him grow up in gruelling poverty - they were duped into believing he would serve a wealthy warlord bordering the next county - where he would learn to read and write - that he would learn to read and write - that he would live in the servants quarters - and that he would send a weekly letter back home - however no such thing ever happened.

Seta's parents contract a fatal disease a few years after transferring ownership of Seta to the proprietor, but their bedside last words are for the racoon-woman to deliver a message to Seta. When Seta was born a racoon-lady annointed himwith myrh, gave him a beastkind blessing and whispered a beastkind name into his ear - all at his parents request.

Seta, now 10, despite severe malnourishment is the strongest slave in the plantation - hence despite being a human - and the taboo of animalism-language - the retaionors human masters awarded him several epithets such as strong as an ox. Draw Seta ploughing with wood over his neck, smiling laughing with propreitors.

This stirs up strong resentment among the fellow slaves, who beat him to pulp several times with potatoes in a sack. This sets in motion, several illnesses and underperformance. They steal his food and replace it for rat droppings. To which the slave masters whip him wiht a "cat of nine tails". It is important to note, all slaves are branded like cattle and have cow bells on their neck to prevent escape. Draw a picture of seta smiling with cow bell - or grinning.

One day under the harsh morning sun, seta notices his masters rushing to put on armour and gather all able bodies men and slaves as the neighbouring warlord is about to invade, drafted as cannon-fodder. Seta is handed a rifle/sword despite not knowing what it is. He sees the window of opportunity, and saying sorry before doing it, the retainers says 'Huh- and with tears he butts him with all his strength, a tooth flying out and he runs away rifle in hand. Although he is wearing the cattle bell, the slave masters have no choice but to postpone his capture as the proprietor hand signals the charge ton the impending enemy forces.

Seta, finds refuge in a primitive cave, to his surprise is occupied by runaway beastkind, who although terrified of him welcome him for being human, in open arms, teach him how to hunt, some of theirlanguage, cooking etc (make fake language in speech bubbles) seta is fascinated by cave paintings of 'animals' which he always thought were myths.


A few years later, his slave master is on a monster hunting trip and one of the slaves who grew up jealous of seta (future rival) alerts his master to a sdinf cattle bell in the distance, without missing a beat, his master fires his rifle, which pings of the indestructable metal alerting the beastkind to the presence of the humans presence in their lands.

Panic runs rampant in the cave, seta knowing that this is his fault.  Bows solemly apologising profusely and decides to hand himself in.
Seta runs away despite the beast kinds pleas, his slave master simply grins at him and when they reunite seta can hear in the distance fire cackling.

He rushes back, not even being chased, and sees the cave lit up he evacuates several beastkind but in the midst of the spook he sees a spellbook touches it and everything goes black
